therefore well opposed to it. Diyna-bc-

consult the Grammars.

Sem-as. This verb is used as almost equal

to habere. So φυλάττειν for ἒχειν. “Are
you, Hector’s Andromache, now the sponse
of Pyrrhus :2¹³ WVagner considers this as an
exclamation of sorrow at her lot, rather
than a question. See, however, note on

wssyrrhin'. The e of the enclitic particle

ne is frequently elided, more especially in the
cogggtpffiffibugh AEneas had referred in the
mildest manner to her state of concubinam,
by using connubium, the tenu for lawful

1111οᾶ811 of her servile condition, as she
manifests by her attitude.

NOTES ΟΝ THE AENEID.

 

B. 111. 330-339.

“famulo me dedit, et quidem me ipsam fam-
ulam”—“gave to Helenus, a slave, me a
slave too'’—a slave like himself. Habentiam
—⁴‘ to be possessed.''

330. Ereptcae conjuctis—“his bei-‘othed
wife, who was nTested from him.¹’

. 331. Scelerum Furiis, ie, the Fun'es—-ffihe
avengers of men's crimes. Orestes , had
slain his mother, Clytaemnestra. ,

332. Εχοῐῃῐτ-“5010115853· The verbssis
used properly of attacking wild beasts from
a place of ambush, but it is frequently
transferred to men. See 318, note.

Patr-ias aras—au altar erected by Neop-
tolemus at Delphi to his father Achilles as
a hero. The enormity ot' the deed is en<
hanced by the circumstance that it⁴was
perpetrated at the altar, which was looked.
gon-affige asylum of the wretched. See

n. 1. .

333. Pars, scil. Epirus, which Neopt.
had added to his patei-nal Phthia.

Reddita. This verb 15 more than simple
clare. It means to give up to one that
which is, in some sense, his right, or that
to which he may have established some
claim. Helenus, as the son of α ki119,1night
expect that, aster faithful guardianship of
the interest οἰ 1115 royal master, he would
come in sor some share of the kingdom at
the death of the latter.

3:34. The Olmones, who derived their origin
from the Pelasgi, were much more ancient
than Helenus and Chaon, but virgil takes
every opportunity of glorifying the ijans,
by connecting them with names famous it:
history or in legend. Chaon is said, by Ser-
vius, to have been a brother or acquaint-
ance of Helenus, and so attached to him
as to have sacrificed his lise to save that ot*
his friend—in grateful remembrance of
which the prophet-son of Priam called
111111181- him the district of Epirus under his
rt e.

336. Perqama I Iiacamque arcem—another
i2nstanee of epexeqesz's, on which see AEn. i.

, 569, note.

337. Burmann finds fault with this line,
on the ground that Andromache ought to
have known what winds would bring AEneaz
from Troy to Epirus, and, to obviate the
difficulty, has recourse to a conj ectural emen-
dation. Heyne shows that there is no difli-
culty, for Andromache is merely askingwh at
is the cause of his coming; was it a stortn
that forced him, or was it fate, οι· the direct
interference of some individual deity'?

This is the reading and punctuation ofW agn.
