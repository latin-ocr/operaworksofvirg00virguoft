the name of a stream rising not farfxom the
sea, and emptying itself into the gulph
of Tergeste (Trieste). Itis said to issue from
caverns amid the rocks in the territory of
the Carni, and to have niue different sources,
which soon sorni one very considerable
stream, called maqnus in Ecl. viii. 6. The
riso of such a river will naturally be very
rapid, and, 111 consequence, it often inun-
dates tue surrounding country. The whole
length of the river does not exceed one mile,
and thus the poet makes Antenor pass 115
ᾒηιηῑιιίυ-ὴραᾰ, though he merely sailed by
its disembogue. The name Timao is still
applied to some springs which rise near Β.

249. Compostus pace.

Heyne, Gossrau,
Hen

ry, and others, consider these words as
descripti-ce of the last days of the life of
Antenor, but WVagn„ Forb.¹ and Jahn, refer
them to his death. See Forb. in loc. This
latter interpretation seems to be supported
by better arguments than its rival. The
two preceding lines sufficiently describe the
temporal welsare of the prince, to crown
which a peaceful death—the very mark
and pineh of happiness—supervened The
adverb nunc, moreoxer, denotes a transitiou
