B. 11. 745-762.

745. Incusarc' deos hominesque. This is
the usual formula iu reference to those who
complaiu grievonsly of their lot.
phrase is also used to signify ererybody with-
out neemiam. The line is hypermetrical, the
que bcingjoined by synopheia to the first word
of the next verse. Weichert supports the
various reading deamque, so as to avoid this
excess ofsyllables; but Jahn argues against
him, that the old form decim is never used
in this particular formula. lVagner con-
ceires Virgil to have used the hypermeter
here to avoid the homoioteleuton iu the
words natumque, virumque, hominumque,
deumque. Dryden suggests, that “It was
not for nothing that this passage was re-
lated with all these tender circumstances:
—AEneas told it—Dido heard it.''

746. Cruciaius, “more grieveus,'' “more
afflicting.''

749. Cinqor—crrmz's, refers· particularly
io the· re-adjustment of his shield, which
had necessarily been displaeed to make way
for his burden. Peerlkamp pronounces the
line spurious: because (lst) Repeto recurs
so soon again (753); and because cinqor
is a term applied to the putting on not of a
slzielsl, but ofa swerd, which AEneas would
not have laid aside.

750. Stat, i.e., decretum est apud me. The
fuller form is stat sententia.

754. Observata per noctem, i.e., with as
much accuraey as Ι could, seeing it was
during the night that 1 had taken. observa-
tions, and was now examining the marks
agam.

755. Silentia-poetic-plur. See Schmitz
Lat. Gr., ξ 76, n. 13 Madvig, ξ 50, obs. 13
Zumpt, ᾗ 92, n. 1.

757. Me resero, i.e., visurus si forte, etc.
Such a verb is often omitted before the
particles si, and sisortb. Cf. Nepos, Hann.
Β. The repetition of siffort& indicates the
most ardent desire for a thing which was
in itself very doubtful and improbable.
Wagner encloses the second sisorae in com-

mas, making it=÷5 τύχοι- ,.

759. Ad auras. Wagner, (Quaest. Virg.
x.) collating the passages where in auras
and ad auras occur, endeavours to show that
<nl auras surqere is said with regard to those
things which raise themselves fron] the
carth so far as yet to touch it, or at least to
be elevated but a small way above it; while
ιη auras suryere means to rise clean into
mid-air. See above, 699, and Ecl. i. 57.

761. Asylo (a, noc and συλᾶω, Idespoil)
—sanctuary of Juno, because she favoured
the Greeks. The spoil was carefully guarded
[οι- equal distribution. Virgil places the
temple of Juno in the citadel, thinking of
that which was built to her ou the Roman
capitot'

762. Phoenix—Ulixes. See class. Dict.

771. The story which follows is necessary
tojustify AEneas in contractiug a marriage
with Laviniau but we shall see, in Book iii.,

tions. It is doubtless one of the passages
which the poet would have altered had he
lived to revise his work.
