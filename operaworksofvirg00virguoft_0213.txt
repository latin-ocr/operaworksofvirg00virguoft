which was round (and not square 01· ob-
long), and covered the whole body.

Phoebeae lampadis—‘⁴ the orb of the sun;¹'
referring only to the shape and size, not to
the brightness.

639. The prevalenee of dactyls, and the
frequent clisions of this line, with the 111)-
rupt break on· in the next, depict forcibly
the haste and exciteinent of the speaker.
The word rumpite, too, is more suitable
here thau solvite would have been.

641. Qualis Polyphemus clandit, i.c.‚ qnalz's
quantusque est Polyphemus qai claicclit, or
quum claudie.

646. Deserta lustra ‹lotamque—*⁴¹th de-
sert haunts and dens of tlte aild ὀπτὰ-133·

647. Ab rupe is joined by Hcyne aud
Henry with Cyclopas, to express that the
Cyclopes wandel-ed about 011 the rocks.
But the sing. rupe is opposed to this, and
the inore natural construction is to connect
the phrase with prospicio.

648. Premiscere is again used trausstively
at xi. 403, with an acc. of the object. Sec
also viii. 669.

653. Addici—“have wholly given myself
up to.'' The word is used of gladiators and
others. who abandon themselves entirely to
the power of another3 or perhaps to the
addictio of debtors.

656. Vasta mole—“of huge size,'' abl. of
quality. Gossrau remarks that the slow
movemeut of the mensure, and the homoio-
teleuton (similar ending) of the lines, suit
well the vast size of the monster and the
slowness of his gait.

658. This linc is composed with wonder-
ful skill. The spondees‚ the equal caesuras,
the frequent elisions, and the harsh sounds
of the words, most admirably express tho
nature of the monstrous Polyphemus.

659. Trunca pinus—“a pine tree lopped
of its branches, (borne) in his hand, (111-6015
him, (eum, understood) and steadies his
steps.” It is almost unnecessary to refer to
the well known passage of Milton, P. L. i.
284, which will occur to every mind—-

His spem, to equal which the tallest pine
Hevm on Norwegian hills, to be the mast
Of some great ammiral, were but a wand,
He walked with to support uneasy steps,
Over the burning marle.

661. Mati. Some copies read malie,
whichWakefield prefers. This line is filled
up in some editions by the words cle collo
fistula pendet, a sillv and unsuitable addi-
tioggz We have here another instance of so-

called hysteron proteron, (ὕστερον τρὸτερθν),
on which see note, Ami. ii. 353, aequora vemt,
though anterior 111 timo to tetiyic flaccus,
being nevel-theless put after it.

1363. Inde—“from it,'' i.e., the sea.

665. Mediam is not to be taken [iteratio—-

it means simply ‘⁵ out 11156ῆῇἱ or “the open
seast' as above, 73, etc.

(367. Sic merito is to be joined to recepto
supplice: “thO had so deserved as that
he should be taken under protection,¹'—-
qai sic (hoc, iul) meruerat ut reaper-etur.

668. Et proni, etc.. “and bending forward
(to the stroke), we sweep the sea plain
with struggling oarsff*

669. Sensitscil.sonitmnremorum. ›S'onitum
vocis. i.e., the voice of the sailors engaging
in the celeusmsoe t'or although they cut the
cable in silence (taciti inciderimtfunem), yet
now, when out 501110 distance to sea, there
was no necessity sor farther refra‘ming,
especially as the oar-plash would suffici-
ently indicate to the gif-nt the position of the
fugitives. Thus angn„ Erum.. and Forlv.
But Heyne takes rocis=soni (as voces pelayi.
556), thc sound ofthe oars, or οἰ t'ne. water
struck by the oars: an interpretation which
few will· approve ot'.

Flectere vestiyia is 11111016 usual expres-
sion thau torquere resiiqia.

670. Dextra affectare, i.e.‚ ‘² to try to
grasp,'¹ ¹⁴ to reach, to lay hold of, (the ship)
with his right hand.vy Most copies read
dextram, after Servius; but this could only
mean, “to grapple tho hand of 11 person.¹'

671. Nec potis, etc. “Nor whilst he sol-
lows (sequendo) is he able to equal the specd
of the Ionian billows '' which bore on the
ship. Cf. AEn. x. 248, ventos aequante sceyitta.
It is not to “ bottom the sea,'‘ as itis usually
explained, after Heync. The Ionian sea
washes the east coast of Sicily.

672. Every schoolboy will here anticipato
us in quoting Shaksp. Jul. Caes.

Have yon not made an universal shout.
That Tiber trembled underneath her bank!
To hear the replication of your sounds
Made in her eoncave shores!

673. Contremuere. Most editions read
intremuere, but Wagn„ Siipfl.. Gossr„ ano
Forb. adopt the former, since contremiscere
means to tremble with a qreat commotiore,
while intremiscere signifies to tremble with
a less violent movement‚ The addition oi
omnes fai-ther confirms the adopted reading.

Pennus—⁴⁴ sar inim1d;'‘ not only the
coasts, but the inland regions.

674. Immuqiit—a. verb properly applied
to subterranean sounds. See above, 92.

676. Complent. This is another instance
of the construction synesis, or ad intellec-
tum, explained in note, AEn. i. 70, which see.
The proper subject is the sing. noun oenus,-
but this word, taken 111 conjunction with
Cyclopum, suggests a plur. to the mind of the
poet, who accordinglywrites complent. Col-
lective nouus are, it is true, construed with
either sing. or plur. verbs, but our present
example is more than a. simple collective.
Cf. Geo. iv. 378, and consult Wagn.Quaest.
