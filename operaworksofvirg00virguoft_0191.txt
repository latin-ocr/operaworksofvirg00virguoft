ARGUMEN'I'

Ari-ER the overthrow of Troy, AEneas builds a fleet of twenty ships at Antandrus, and
having set sail in company with a considerable number of fellow-exiles, lands first in
Thrace. There he begins to found a eity; but the shade of Polydorus (a son of Priam,
jvho had been slain by king· Polyinnestor) warns him to avoid the cursed land, which he
immediately abandons (l-72). Reaching Delos, he consults the oraele of Apollo with
regard to his Journey and final settlement, but, by a misinterpretation of the response, ho
steers for Crete instead of Italy (73-120). Here, again, ill omens and a plague retard the
building of his rising city; but being accurately and distinctly instructed by the Penates.
who appeared to him in sleep, he finally directs his course to Italy (121-191). But he is
overtaken by a storm, and is wasted to the islands, Strophades, infested by the Harpies
(192-269), thence to Actium, where he celebrates games in honour of Apollo (270-290).
Passing Corcyra, he lands in Epirus, and finds it ruled over by Helenus, one of the sons
of Priam, to whom, after the death of Pyrrhus, the kingdom had fanen, and along with
it Andromache (formerly the w-ife of Hector). He is received with great kindness by
these his former friends, and instrueted by Helenus in all the labours and dangers that
yet await him 011 his voyage (291—505). Crossing to the Italian shore, he coasts south-
ward, and approaches the distn'ct of Sicily near to AEtna, where he narrowly escapes the
cyclopes, by informatiou of a Grecian, who had been abandoned on the island by Ulysses,
and again stands out to sea (506-683). The warnings of Helenus enable him to escape
the daug-ers of Scylla and Charybdis, and aster a circnitous course to reach Drepanum,
where his father Anchises dies: and whence setting sail he is driven to Carthago
(684—718). The action of this Book extends over a period of seven years-from the sack
of Troy till ’.116 arrival of AEncas in Africa. The historical, geographical. and mythological

references arr very numerous, and afford proof of the great learning os vire-il iu tli'ese
