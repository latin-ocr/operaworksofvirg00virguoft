14. Peerlkamp condemns lines 13 and ,14
as spurious, on the ground that the descrip-
tion of Carthage given in them must refer
to the time of the Punic wars, and not to
the period of Dido's sovereignty. But Rau
defends the verses, and justifies the epithets
in them, on the plea that Vix-gil views Car-
thage as, even in the time of AEneas, a
treasure house of Tyrian wealth, and as ne-
cessarily warlike, from its contests with the

Aspmma—The following note on this
word from HEYNE is worthy of attention:

mark exists], ‘that' the ὃ is in arsis, and,

Ecl. ii. 53. Colzcisse-the gods were sup-
posed to dwell particularly in those places,
which they took under their especial pro-
tection.

17. Hic currus fuit. This idea is taken
from the custom of warrior-s, who, on their
return from battle, put aside their chariots in
sheds. The gods are represented as doing
so likewise: see Hom. 11. viii. 441, and v.
720. In assigning a ehariot to Juno at
Carthage, Virgil is more poetic than cor-
rect, for there she was represented as sit-
ting on a lion. The penult of <illius is here
shortened by Virgil, as it is almost always
in alterius, but ahnostmever in solius and
never in alius. See EcL i. 7, and Geo. i. 49.
