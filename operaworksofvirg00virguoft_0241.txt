part only to take a share in the contests.

109. Munera-the rewards ot' victory,

τὰ ἆθλα. Circum—the place where the
contests were held. From Homer we learn
that tripods were the rewards of bravery
among the Greeks.

from whom Virgil seigns the Memmian qens

Virgil assigns to the heroic age an inven-

Virgil's time, the Roman gentes sought to
fierive their names and traee their descent
from 'l'roj 1111 heroes. Many of these attempts
were very sar-fetched; thus, as Mnestheus

was deduced from μεμνῖσέαί, so Memmius
from Meminisse, its Latin equivalent. Cen·-

128. Api-icus commonly means ‘⁴ sunny,''

exposed to the sun:'' but here it signifies

“leving the 51111,” “delighting to bask in

chosen because they celebrated funeral

of the 5111110 word emendations have been
proposed. These, however, seem unncces-
sat-y, since the words are used in different
senses, the former referring to the stretch of
