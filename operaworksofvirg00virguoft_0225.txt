242. Virqam-the cacluceus. See Mythol„
Keightley.

243. Mittit— “conducta'' The- Greeks

called him νεκροπομπός, πομπαῖος·

2-1-1. Lumina morte resiqnac. These words
have caused great difficulty to commenta-
tors. We simply enumerate the 111-1110111111
explanations: (1,) Ηο relaxes their eyes
iu <leath; rest'qnare having thus the same
meaning as solvere. Heync aud Forcell.
(2,) Ηο opens again the eyes ot' the dying
when on the point of death, i.e., he rec-alls
1110 dyingto life. lVagner. (3.) As Mercury
{rives and tle-prives of sleep, so 110 astam scals
1110 eyes in the slcep of death. Jahn. (4,)

Mercury, the ψυχᾶπθμπὸἱ, opens 1110 eyes
ot‘the dead whom he is about to conduct to
Orcus: for the shades in the. lower regions
are represented as seeinq. Henry, followed
lay For-biger.

247. The story of Atlas, son of Japctus
autl Clymene, turned into a mountain by
Perseus, and compelled to bear the world
uu his shoulders, is well known. Mercury
ulighted on the peak (apicem) of Atlas, as
being higher ground, preparatory to 1115 de-
scent to the plain. The epithet duri is ap-
plied on account of the toils of Atlas, and

1110 circumstances recorded in ⁴249 sqq.

249. Pinifer is not 10 be interpreted too
litei-any: it is a general epithet. of moun-
:ejus in the poets.

252. Nitens — “ poising himself.” Cyl-
lenizts; he was born on Mt. Cyllenus, in Ar-
cadia. Cf. Milton, 111 1115 description of the
descent ot* Gabriel.

254. Ari—a Meryus, or some such 11511-
nunter, which soars at a considerable height
above the water, and, after mai-king its prey,
swoops down upon it with the violence of a
hurricane.

256. The authenticity of this and the two
following verses is doubted hy almost every
commentator. The following are among the
obJections urged: (1,) 257 15 absent from
some MSS.. 258 from most, while in others
257 15 placed after 258. (2,) The lines are

very tame, insipid, and rugged. (3,) The!

homoioteleuton, volabat and secabat. (4.)
The asyndeton (want ofeonjunctions) 111 the
verses, and the extraordinary connexion of
the words licus arenosum ac Libyae ventosque
secabat. But, besides these, WVagner puts
forn-ard others 2—(l,) The words terras inter
coelumque, which imply high flight, ill ac-
cord with humilis-juxta aequora of the pre-
ceding line. (2.) The reference to Mer-
cuzy's mother and grandfather is spir-itless,
andiu placed. (3,) Ι1 15 absurd to extend
the compar-ison through so many lines,
when the subject is a trix-iul affair, espe-

cially as Vin-gil uses haud aliter only in derived from aneu* marriage in ltaly.

spieuous. liVagner farther imagines, that
some grammarian added the lines lest the
reader might suppose that αιί similis in ‘256
might be interpreted literally as if Mer—
cury were in shape ofa bird; and that 258
was appendcd lest the svly‘ect should bc
wanting, while 257 found a place in the
text to explain circum litora, circum
scopulos of 254, 5.

257. Licus arenosum m· Libyae. This
W'agner takes to be thc true reading. the
interpolator having* inserted (ιε 111 the third
place, for «c litus arenosum Libyae. Others
write cul, and others omit altogether.

¹258. Maia, 1110 mother of Mcrcury. was
one ofthe Pleiades, the daughter of Atlas
and Pleione. The Romans called the
Pleiades. l'ergliliaf.

21³0. Tecta⁴ ,novantem—building a new
private mansion sor himself.

2⁴31. Conspicit. Atque. This is W'agncr's
punctuation: a semicolon is usually placed
after conspicit. Wagner asserts that this
particle, atque, when placed at the begin—
ning of a sentence, expresses amazemcnt at
some unexpected circumstance. It herc
indicates the astonishment of Mei-cury at
the dress of AEneas, and the total change of
his manners and character. Stellatits, viz„
on the hilt and scabbard.

{aspide—four syllables.

262. Laena—:czm‘m was a peculim· kind
of woollen cloth, with a long loosc nap,
not made into any particular shape of robe,
but used as an outer hap in vax-lons forms.
See Ramsay's Rom. Antiq. Ardebat=splem
debat.

Mures—a shell-fish which supplied a
purple dyc. It was round in large quan-
tities at Tyre, on the coast of Laconia, and
other places. See v. 205.

264. Telos—“the warp.'' Dido had inter-
woven‚ here and there, “fine threads of
gold.'’ See iii. 483.

265. Invadit—“angrily addresses.'' The
word is characteristic of the speech of
Mercury, and indicative of the tenor ofwhat
is to follow.

269. Torquet refers to 1110 revolution of
the earth ou its axis, for Virgil was awai-e
Terram circum arem se summa celeritate
convertere et torquere, ,Cic. Acadfiiv. 39,

comparing 236, Ausoniam prolem, thinks
that he has caught Virgil “ napping.'’
Forbiger defends the poet by saying that
he is herc correcting himself, justly think-
ing that at this very time. when AEneas
was held in the chains of Dido's love,
Ascanius would naturally be of more
concern to him than any offspring to be
