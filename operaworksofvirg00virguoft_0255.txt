NOTES ΟΝ THE AENErD.

B. V. 735-755.

718. Pernzz'sso nomine, i.e.‚ AEneas, though rather to the places where the concilia met

the founder of the colony, and therefore pos-
sessing the right to have the name ot= the
city, will give up his claim to Acestes.
Acesta was that famous city of Sicily called
AEgesta by Diodorus and Strabo, Eyesta by
Thucyd„ and Segesta by the later Romans.

720. Animum—some books read animo.

721. Polum. the zenith. Nox was supposed
to rlse in the west, gain the zenith by mid-
night‚ and set in the east at sunrise.

722). Coelo delapsa. As Anchises was in
Elysium, we must consider the phrase as
used in its common signification of any sud-
den appearance3 as we say, “dropped from
the clouds.'' But Jupiter may have sent a
messenger to assume the form of Anchises,
since he says Jovis imperio hac venio.

730. Aspera cultu, Le.. quae aspera vila
utitur, “which lives a savage lit'e.'' The
word asper is applied to substanees whose
sun-face is wzeven and roualt, and so trans-
{enred to men of uncivilized manners.

731. The first hint of the visit osAEneas to
the infernal regions is given in the prophecy
os Helenus, AEn. iii. 441. Since the spirit
of Anchises might as well have recorded
ull events to AEneas when it appeared to
him, without entailing on the Trojan prince

- so dangerous an expedition as one to Hades,

ἶνας-Δι- excuses the introduction of the Epi-
sode only on the ground that Virgil was
carried away by his desire of imitating his
great master. whose Necyomanteia in the
Odyssey is one of the most beautiful parts of
that delighrful poem, and admirably adapted
to adorn the story of the Latin hard. Dis,
ig, Dives, Πλούτων (from πλοῦτος,
wealth) because to him, says Cicero, N. D.
ii. 26, 66, omnis terrena vis acque natura decli-
cata est omniaque et recidant in terras et ori-
antur e terris.

732. Per alta Averna—properly through
the lake Avernus, but here we must under-
stand it ot= a cave in a vaney near Avernus,
by which an entrance was cffected.

734. Tristesqzce. Wagn, Siipfl., Gossr.,
etc„ read ve, but Jahn, Forb., and others
que, as the uniformity is thus kept up
between the two clauses tartara umbraeque.
and amoena concilia Elysiumque, and as a
Ι less jejune sense is thus ufforded. Tartara

and umbi-ce unite into one idea= and refer
to one and the same place3 and although
all things belonging to the affilirs of the
dead are called tristia. yet here the opposi-
uon of amoena piorum concilia shows that it
is the shades of the wicked that are more
particularly intended.

On Amoenus consult Kritz.Sall. Cat. 11, 5.

The word is akin to ἀμείνων, and signifies

thau to the concilia themselves.

735. Sibylla. See vi. 10, below. Sanquine
is the abl. of the instrument.

738. The superstitious ancients believed
that spirits could not await the first beams
of the sun, and thus the arrival of night
at the zenith (when in early times the
civil clay began), and the first breuth of
the horses of Sol, warn the shade of An·
chises to disappear. Cf. Shakspere, Ham-
let, where the Ghost says, ⁴‘ Fare-thee-well
at once! the glowworm shows the mutin
{ic} be near, and 'gius to pale his ineffectum

e..

741. Deincle=hinc, ἐ’νὲἑν, so that the sense
is, thy do you not romain longer? Quo
proripis, scil. te, which is always expressed,
but here omitted on the analogy of the
other verbs, fuyz's and ruis, signifying
motion.

744. Larem Perqameum. By this some
understand the shade of Anchises, since the
souis of ancestors were treated as Lares,
others believe Vesta to be meant; Heyne,
however, considers it to indicate the Penates,
with whom the Lares were ol'ten con-
founded.

Penetralicc Vincite, for Vestarm her image
was kept in the inner part of the temple,
veiled and undefiled by the gaze of the
multitude. She is called Cana, 011 account
ot* the antiquity of her religion.

745. Farre pio, ie.. mola salsa, for which
see Ramsay's Antiq.

Acerra is properly the incense censer, but
here the incense itsels3 cf. Hor Od. iii. 23,
19, Molliri( aversos Penates, Farre pio et
saliente valea.

746. Arcessit, otherwise written accersit,
which was for a time considered a corrupt
form introduced in the period of decliniug
Latinity‚ hut which has recently found de-
tknders in Schneider, Zumpt, D6c1e1·1ei11,·
Kritz, ete.

750. Transcribunt.
from one city to another were said trans-
cribi. but colonists were said adscribi.

752. Ipsi, i.e.‚ those who were about to
pursue their journey. Reponunt, i.e., reno-
vant, reparant.

754. Vivida virtus. The irregularity of
the syntax adds force to the expression:
Eziqzci *numero secl tales quihus sic bello
(ad bellum) vivida virtus.

755. The founder οἴ a city having his toqa
folded in a. peculial· manner, part being·
thrown over his head„ and part passed
round his waist like a girdle (cincta Gabino),
marked out the limits ot‘ the town by a
furrow. care being taken that the clods of
earth should all be turned inwade. and :nat
