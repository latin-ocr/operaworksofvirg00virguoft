566. It is to bc borne in mind that AEneas
and his companions were fighting from the
tower of the palace. myra—because ex-
hausted by fighting, or because they were
perishing by a most shocking death—the
scorching of the flames.

567. This, and the following twenty-one
lines, are not found in the best codices, and
are passed over, without illustration, in the
commentar-ies of Servius, Donatus, and
Pomponius. Tucca and Varius, who un-
der-took the revision of the poem after Vir-
gil's death, are said to have cancellcd them,
either because they deemed it disgraeet'ul
to the hero of an Epic to lay violent hands
on a female, ο1· because the verses appeared
to contradict AEn. vi. 510 sqq. They arc,
however, of the same character as tlte four
with which, in some. copies, the AEneid be-
gins, and are found in those MSS. which
exhibit tlte som· referred t0. Moreover,
their diction and finish mark them out as
Virgilian, and, besides, the context would,
without them, bc incomplete. For, if Vir-
gil (lid not write these verses, line 582)
should exhibit hic or tum instead of cum,
unless, indeed, we adopt the suggestion of
Jahn, that lines 565 and 566 may be paren-
thetic, and that the connection will thus go
on from lustro (564) to cum (589). But,
farther, if the suspected passage be omitted,
the sudden arrival of Venus, to ruge AEneas
to do what he was about to carry into effect
of his own accord, will appear more un-
called-for, and her references, in <indomitae
irae. (594), to the state ot' her son's mind
as detailetl in 575, aud in Tyndaridis facies
(601), to 567 sqq., will be wholly useless
and inexplieable. In answer to the two
main objections noted above, it may be
urged—(lst,) That iEneas was fairly ex-
cusable 1'01· entertaining the thought of

'slaying Helen, seeing that hc looked upon
her as not only the cause of the whole war,
but also as the betrayer of her recent
friends; and when, attho moment he had
been keenly reminded of the probable fate
of his father, wife, and chjhl, through her
sinful weakness. The poet, it seems, had
tnticipated this objection in 583 sqq., and
answered it in 585 sqq—(ech) In palliation
of the apparent inconsistcney with vi. 510
sqq„ we need only be reminded that Vir-gil
took his materials fron: various sources, and
that he did little more than (li-ast a full out-
line of the poem to bc polished and com-
pleted by revision, but that he did not live
