battle of Allia. See Niebuhr-'s Lects. on
Rom. Hist„ vol. i., p. 268 sqq.

827. Funere, so scatere, fervere, stridc're,
ete, according to the custo-m ot' a generation
earlier than Virgil.

828. Nocte, i.e., in darkness, for although
Elysium had a sun of its own (641), yet wc

831. Socer—for Julia, the daughter of
Caesar‚ was wife to Pompey. Alpinis—re-
ferring to Caesar's march from Gaul. Mts.
ase called amere& because they serve as
embankments of defence to the countries
which they surronnd. Monoeci—at the
extremity of the Maritime Alps was a pro-
montory with a temple to Hercules Mo-
noecus, not sar from Nicaea. Poinpey's
forces were mostly Eastern.

835. Tu prior, parce—supposed to have
reference to the proposal of Caesar to the

⁸ 837Ι 8, have reference to L. Mummius
Achaicus, the conqueror of Corinth, and
humbler of Greece, Rc. 146.

839. There is a difficulty to know the in-
dividual meant in this and the following
lines: verse 840 shows that it cannot be
Mummius. The older interpreters referred
it to CurfflsDentatus, or Falnicim, the
conqueror of Pyrrhus, but 3:39 sorbids that.
lleyne concludes that L. AEmilius Paulus,
who defeated Perseus, is intended, and that
the latter is called Aeacides, because the Ma—
cedonian kings belonging to the Heraclidae
traced their genealogy from Olympias, the
daughter of Neoptolemus (son of Achilles,
descendant of AEaeus), king of Epirus.

840. Achilli. On this form of the gen„
see AEn. i. 30, and ii. 476.

841. Ultus avos Trojaex These words
supply the reason why the victory referred
to should be mentioned, for what more
agreeable to the feelings of Trojans than
that the descendants of Achilles should, at
some future day, pay to the Trojans full
satisfaction for the calamity which they
had brought on them, in the death of friends
and the destruction of property and city?
The reference may be either to the con-
quests of Mummius, or better, perhaps, to
those of AEmilius Paulus, which were made
over the posterity of Achilles

Templa temerata M mervae, scil., bij ax,
son of Oileus (see AEn. i. 41, and ii. 403),
and by Ulysses and Diomede in the carry-
ing off of the panadium (see ii. 165 sqq.)

with mol-hardy daring.” Forb.
