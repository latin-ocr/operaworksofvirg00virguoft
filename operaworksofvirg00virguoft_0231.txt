NOTES ΟΝ THE AENEID.

B. IV. 506-512.

506. Fronde funerea-more particularly
the leaves of the cypress.

508. Effi9iem—an image of the person

*o their source, was attributed to the magi.

490. Nocturnas, i.e., noctu, see above,
303. note.

491. Ornos—not aslz trees only, but all
kinds.

493. Accingier—the old infi sor accingi,
on w-hich see Donaldson's Varronianus. p.
360 (211. ed.) It is here middle voice, “that
1 gird myself with magio arts,'' as my wea-
pons, Le, that ‘⁴ I have recourse to.” Such
an apolog-y was unnecessary for Dido and
her times, but it would have been requisite
in the case of a Roman of Virgil‘s age (see
note, AEn. i. 469), when magio rites were
condemned, and even subJ'ected those who
engaged in them to accusation before the
law courts. Δ

Artes is the accus. of tlte remote object,
on which see AEn. i. 228, and ii. 210, note.

494. Sub auras—sub means motion from
below, upwards, so that the phrase signifies
“to raise a pile up towards heaven.” As the

Greek aspiration=s, and πεῖ), ειὼεῦπό-
Heyue explains sub auras as merely =sub
divo, “ in the open air.”

495. The woodcut represents a pyre, or
ara sepulchri, as it is otherwise called. with
a dead body laid thereon. For a description
of it see Ramsay, Rich, or s1nith; and on
the funeral cercmonies generally, consult
the same authorities.

 

Arma—that is, the sword, mentioned
below, 507 and 646.

497. Wagn reads superimponunt (scil.
famulo which Forb.¹ deeming inconsistent
with secreta, rejects, and adopts the lection
superimponas.

498. Juvat (συμΐὲρει).-“ it is neces-
sary.’' or ‘⁸ expedient. ¹ Jutzet is another
reading.

500. Anua's character, unsuspicious and
devoid of penetration, is well chosen, to ren—
der the working out of the catastrophe more
easy and natural.

502. Aut for nec, aster the preceding uec.

505. raedis et ilice secta ⁴⁴ of pitch niues

important parts of the magical rite. As the
wax os the image mehed, the faithless lover
was supposed either to melt again to affec-
tion. or to be consumed by a miserable
death, as a reward for his perfidy. The
latter result was the one wished for by
Dido.

509. Effusa crines—another example ot
the aec. astera passivepart.; see note on AEnt
i. 2⁶28: ii 210. Transl.‚ “with dishevelled
locks.'' Sacerdos. i.e.‚ the Massylian pries-
tess mentioned above, 483.

510. Ter centum tonat deos— “thrice
invokes with loud voice a hundred gods.''
Thus Wagn. in his larger editi0n3 but in
his smaller he joins tercentum, considering
it equivalent to plurimos. Sehiraeh and
Thiel write tercentum, but take it adverb-
ially, (not joined to deos) equal to multi-

plrcster, multis nominibus.

ChErebm, brother of Tartarus, and sou οἵ
aos.

Chaos (χάω, χαίνω, whence χάσμα),
the great. void in which all things were
found; it is sometimes put for Orcus.

511. Tergeminam Hecaten and tria ora
Dianae mean the same thing. for Diana
was called by three names-Luna in heaven
—Diana on earth—and Hecate in the
lower regions, and in this triple form she is
represented in the woodcut below. The
gods invokedwere of course infernal ones.

 

512. *Lances simulatos Averni—- ‘⁴ -rhe

water pretending to be from Avermm¹‘
