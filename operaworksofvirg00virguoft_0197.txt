According io the most ancient rables,
Teucer was a native of 1110 Τ1·οα(1, 1110 5011
of the river god Scamander and an Idae—an
nymph. Later traditions represented him
as the son ot'a Cretan noble, Scamander, and
Idaea, a. Cretan nymph. Compelled by a
famine to migrate from his nat-ive island to
Phrygia, in company with his father, hc
there married the daughter of Dardanus,
settled permanently in the country, and
gave his name 10 1110 Trojans.

Rhoeteas orm, i.e., 'trojanas—so called from
the promontory Rhoeteum on the Helles-
pont.

109 and 110, Virgil has again translated
literally. See llom. 11. xx. 216-213.

111. Hinc, etc. “Hence (from Crete)
came the mother (of the gods) who (111-0115
in Mount Cybele (in Phrygia) —thc brazen
cymbals of the Corybantes, too, and the
ldaean grovez—hence were derived the
mysteries ofher (Cybele's) 1·ites,and hence,
too, yoked lions drew the chariot of their
queen.'' The Corybantes are cont'oundcd
with the Curetes, though distinct from them.
The Corybantes (whose name, as well as

that. of the Curetes, was derived from κῦρος,

κθῧρῖς, 01· from κὸρυς) were the armed
priests. of Cybele, and worshipped their
deity with dancing, 1110 lond din of armour,
and the sound of cymbals. Cybele is as-
signcd two lions yoked to a ear, in token that
maternal affection can tame the most savage
natnres.

115. Gnosia regma, i.e., Cretan. from
Gnossus, 1110 principal town 01· the island.

116. Nec distant Ionyo cursu-about 150
miles. Cursu, abl. of measure. Adsit, “be
propitious.''

118. Aris=ad aras, according 1ο Heyne.
Forb„ however, considers it the (lam, and
explains “victimas quae m aris concrema-
rentem-J· He explains similarly Geo. ii. 350,
caper omnibus aris coeclicnr.

119. Neptune is conciliaied as god ofthe
sea, prospectu-ely sor their voyage—Apollo
as having given the response. A Μαι-λ’
sheep is offered to Hiems. as 1110 storin 11-
self is dark and gloomy, with its threatening
clouds—a while 0110 10 1110 zophyrs, as
θεν-1311131119 and nnlzl.

122. Idomeneus, son of Deucalion, and
grandson of Minos, had led a hand of Cre—
tans to the Trojan war. On his return, be-
ing endangered by a storm, he vowed
to sacrifice to tho gods, if spared by them,
whatever first met him on reaching his own
house. Meriones, his son, became the melan-
choly victim. A pestilence having visited

, the island some time posterior to this, 1110

crime of Idomeneus was considered the
cause, and he was in consequence exiled;
110. settled in the Sallentino territory, in the
, §south et* ltaiy. N

Naro. Bacclzatum jzzqis, ⁴⁶ whose snm-
mits were the scenos of bacchanalian re·

ot* a deponent verb being used passu-ely.
See Geo. ii. 487, Donusa, now Denusa, one
ot'the Sporades, to 1110 west of Patmos. It is
called Viridis, not so much from the colonr
of its marble as from the verdnre of its fields.

126. macros—(called afterwards Anti.-
paros, from its position west, and opposito
to Paros), 0110 os the Sporades, and famedi
forits grotto. Paros, one of the Cyclades,
samed 1'0r.its snowy white marble, cut in
Mt. Marpesus, hence the epithets niveus,
nitens, fulqens, etc.⁸ applied by the poets.
Hor. 111. 28, 14, calls all the Cyclades
nitentes.

The Parian, or “Arundel marbles,” con·
1011111113Γ nu: annals of Athens froin 13.c. 1582
to nc. 264, were ent on this marble. They
were discovered by M. De Pierese, from
whom they were purchased by the Earl οἵ
Arundel, and presented to 1110 University
cf Oxford.

placed around Delos, with that island as
the cestre.

For concil«, some books read consita—-
‘⁴ thiekly stiulded,'' but this does not. agree
well with sparsas. Transi, therefore, “ they
crnise through the sti-aits, chased by reason
of the many islands.'' The waves pent up
in the nari-ow channels had not room to
expand, and gradually diminish in size, and
therefore rose higher and boilcd more
ficrcely than out at sea, rendering the navi-
gation dangerous. Forb. shows that the
common reading, consita, and its explana-
tion, would prove Virgil guilty of a geogra-
phical blundcr of a very serious kind.

128. Vario certamine. Forb. considers
vario as more properly belonging to clamor
(mccllagle), 10 express the variety of manner
and of sound with which the sailors uttered
their mutual exhortatione.
