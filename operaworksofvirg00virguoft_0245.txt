253. Α difficulty has been found in re-
conciling this linc with 255, and Virgil is
accused of ‘⁶ noddinffi' in introducing such
a confused description of a. picture which
exhibits Ganymede now at the chase, and
now in mid air in the talons of the engle.
But it. may rcadily be supposed that the
picture consists ol* two parts, the first re-
presenting the boy at the chase,·the second
his abduction ; or, as Heync explains= veloces

273. Ssepe used as quondam or olim. This
diflicnlt passage may be thus translated :—
⁵⁵As, when surprised on the highway, a ser-
pent is u‘ont to act (over which the iron-
shod whecl has passed, or which the traveller
dealing heavy blows has left hals-dead and
mangled with stones): As 110 strives to
escape, he describes in vain with his body
long ’Νι-041111)- twistings, savagely energetic
in one part (of his body), and tlashing fire
from his eyes, and raising his hissing erest
as hc rears himself on high; the part which
is nmimed with wounds retards him though
he struggles (to rest) on his knotted wreaths
and coils himself up within his own folds.u
Trapp makes the following ι111111010115 re-
marks on the whole passage-² ⁶* There never
was a finer simile than this, It will be ob-
jectcd, perhaps, that a ship is not like a
snake: 1 own it is not, any more than it is
like a dove, to which another ship is 00111-
parcd a little before. But the comparisons
are sofar from being faulty upon this ac-
count, that sor this very reason they are
the more beautiful. considering that the
particular circumstances upon which the
similitudcs turn do so very nearly resemble.

with difficulty gettIng ont from a narrow
passage, and then swiftly dying away into
