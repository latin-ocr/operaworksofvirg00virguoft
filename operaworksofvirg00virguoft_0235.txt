B. tv. 619-634.

619. Fruatur luce. He is said to have
reigned only three years, aud to have been
drowned in the river Numicius-his body,
however, was never recovered. To this
line (32²0 refers.

6-20. It has been asked, What does que
connect? and it has been said that inhuma-
tus is for neque humetur. But it is better to
consider ante diem as in meauinq, though
not in form, an adj.=immamrus-a con-
struction which might be abundantly illus-
strated from English as well as Latin
authors. ‘

623. Eoeercete odiis—referring. of course,
to the Punic wars. Observc the position
of munera. similar to that of naviqet noted
in 237. above.

625. Exoriare, much stronger than arori-
atur, for it expresses a confident expectation
that such a one m‘ll arise, though she can-
not name the individual. The ultor is
Hannibal. Ex· ossibus, i.e., not by qenero-
tzon, but as it were from her very liinbs. in
a figurative sense.

629. The hypermeter syn. que (to be
j0ined by synapheia to the next line} is
very unusual at the end of a completed sen-
tenco. on which account some editors have
rejected the latter half of the verse. and
others the que. Wagner and Forb. retain
the line in full, considering that the hyper-

, metrical syllable is intentional. We are to
imagine, they say, that the excited feelings
of Dido, and her eager haste in speaking,
had rendered her almost breathless, aud
that the last words arc uttered with a
panting and failing voice, the que betraying
nn intention to say more, which the powers
of speech refused.

631. Abrumpere lucem-the idea of violent
geakinq has reference to the thread of the

estinies.

633. This line is considered spurious by
some editors on account of the trivial na-
ture of the informaffion, and the unusual
phrase cinis me habet. Forb. defends its
genuineness by replying to the first objec-
tion that the great importance attached to
nurses, aad the large influence exercised
by them, are sufficient grounds for the in-
troduction of this piece of intelligence; and
to the second, that as the phrase cinis sum
is common. aud tumulo ἰινηα haberi is a
mere variation of the one here used, wc are

justified in adinitting cinis habet as a poetic

fancy. Instead of suus we might at first
sight expect Esus, but the sentiments are

Dido's, and therefore the refiexjve prou. is

quite right. ' =

634. Gara mihi. i.e.‚ “though not my
nurse. but the nurse of Sychaeus, yet dear
to me.‘' Wakefield removes the commas,

the brevity of the phrase does not. allow tn

635. Fluviali lympha. i.e., vivo flumine
Ablutions were necessary previous to indi-
viduals eugaging in sacred lites.

636. Mauso-ata, scil. α sacerdote. Consult.

Antiq.‚ p. 339 sqq.

638. Styqiolovi‚i.e.,1³luto, Ζεὺς κειτα-

641. Anilem aradum—the more common
reading is anili, to agree with studio. ano
this certainly suggests a much more beau-
tiful idea than the lection adopted hy Forb.‚
Wagn., etc„ anilem. The epithet asjoined
to Ursulum is very. insipid and common-
plncc; while, by attaching it to studio, you
bring ont one of the characteristics of old
age, generally, and especially that which
might be expected in a loniestic‚ who had,
bly long residence, become almost one 01

643. Acies is not used of the eye simply,
but only when itis excitcd aud has astar-ted
appearance through anger, or any othe»v
violent emotion.

644. Intetfusa qenas. See note, AEu. 1.
2¹28, and ii. 210. Muculis—the trnth of

executions of the Foench Revolution.
Many os those whose hair or robes were
cut off at the neck, in preparation sor the
guillotine, had on their faces red and livid
spots.

650. With this passage, cf. Sopho Trach-
917 sqq„ where ch auita slays herself on the
couch of Hercules: see also Eur. Alcestis,
where Alcestis ssings himself on the nuptial
conch. Nouissimas is often used for ultimus,
so novissimum aqmen.
