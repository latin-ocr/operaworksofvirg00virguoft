orientis* onustum, shows that ¹Augustus is
here meant, and not Julius Caesar. Pulchra
means simply “ distinguished‚” “ noble.''

’ The epithet Trojanus is added, because

Augustus was received by adoption into the
Juliu qens.

287. The empire extended, under Augus-
tus, from the Atlantic to the Ganges, and
from the Rhine to the wastes of the Libyan
desert.

239. 'Ibe expedition referred to in Orientis
is that undertaken in 30 13.c. to Egypt, etc.
The first books of the AEneid could not
make reference to the Parthian expedition,
which was not entered upon till ten years
later, 13.c. 20.

290. Secura, “freed from anxiety.'' In
our translation of the Bible, the word secure
is used in this sanie sense. See Juclyes

291. Reference is made in this line ‘co the
shutting of the temple of Janus, B.c. 29, and
the existence of peace over the whole Roman
world.

292. Cana — “ hoary,'' “ancient,” i. e..
Virtue stem as was that of the ancients.
Or nclothed in white.'' See Hor. Od. i. 35,

Fides, Vesta, aud Quirinus forn] the subject of
dabunt. Quirinus cumfratre may bc meant
io indicate Augustus and Agrippa, or to
siguify in a general way the cessation of
civil war, and the consequent harmony
among brothers.

294. Belli portae—the gates of the temple
of danus. Niebuhr explains this custoni by
supposing that it originated in early times,
when the Roman and Sabine cities, Remu—
ria and Quirium, the nucleus of Rome,
passed tluough the gate which connected
the two, to render assistance to each other
when necessity required. It was ordered
by Numa that the gates should be open in
war and shut in peace. They had been
closed in the reign of Numa, and again at
the conclusion of the First Punic WVar.
They are seen closed in the woodcut below.

295. Furor is personified and'assooiated
with War in his imprisonment in the temple
of Janus. Virgil is supposed to have re-
ference, iu these two lines, to a picture by

behind his back, following the triumphai
car of Alexander the Great. This picture
was dedicated by Augustus in the Forum.

Maia, daughter of Atlas; the place of his
birth was Mount Cyllene in Arcadia.

298. Domum—putesnet—arceret. Observo
the variation of tense in these verbs—a

Kritz ad Sall. Cat 34, 1, and 41, 5.

his posumus*

301. The name Poeni indicates the Phoe-
nician origin of the Carthaginians. Poenus

is Just Φὸινιξ adapted to the analogy of the

this the more usual form Punicus.

qui volverat—⁴⁴ after having ponde1·ed;''

393. So coerula coeli.

312. Comitatus, used passively, though
the participle of a deponent verb. The act.
form cornito, is frequent, however.

313. Bina for duo. Cyrspans, i.e.‚ ‘ci-
brans. ·Henry (Class. Mus. vol. vi.) alleges
that no idea of brandishing is contained in
the word, and, moreover, that the notien
of such an action is quite unsuited to t'ne
