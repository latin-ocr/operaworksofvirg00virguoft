538. Ferre dederat—see above, 247.

5⁴1. Praelato honori—‘⁴ nor did the gene—
rous Eurytion envy him the honour ranked
before his own.'' Heyne considers prcelato
as almost equal to praerepto, which use of
the word Wagn. deeins without precedent.
The latter explains thusz—“Nor does Eury-
tion feel envy at, Acestes because he is pre-
ferred to him, and because the honour which
¹he had hoped for himself is transferred to
iis rivah'* ‘

543. Proximus inqreclz'tm· donis, i.e., He
(Mnestheus) is next presented with his
prize, and marches proudly forth in exulta-
tion. Donis does not depend, in YVagner's
opinion, on either irrqrffllitztr or proximus,
hut on the idea of ‘⁴ cominq second& which
arises from both taken together.

544. In the programme of the gamos,

above, 66 sqq.. AEneas made no mention osv

the combat now to be entered on, which,
therefore, comes unexpectedly, and on that
account more agreeably to the assembled
throng. These games were kept up by
Angustus; see below, 601.

certamine, scil. of the archers.

546. Custodem—see above, note 256.

547. Epytides. Periphas, son of Epytus,
ananie borrowed from Hom. ΙΙ. xvii. 323.
He was the herald of Anchises, :ind friend
of AEneas; he had grown old in the service
of the family.

Ad aurem means “confidentially and
privately,'' but in aurem (which some edi-
tions read) expresses more seerecy, and a
greater desire to conceal the information
from others.

549. ursus iustruxit equorum, i.e., has
prepared the horses for their manoeuvres.

550. Avo—“in honour of his grandfathen'*

555. Fremit is often followed by the nec.
of the thing, but here it is construed un-
usually with the acc. of the person. M irata
fremit—gaze 011 with loudly-expressed ad-
mirmion.

556. Tonsa corona, etc. By this Heyne
understands that a gai-land (plucked and
eropped so as to be ot* equa! length all
round) was placed on the helmet of each,
and that thus it was said to press their
hair, or that it fell so far over the margin
of the helmet. as to touch the curls which
appeared from beneath the head-picce.
Peerlkamp, interpreting premere comam as
“binding up the hair, to keep it from flow-
ing loosely, and thus intert'cring with the
active exertion of riding, und with the
ridel-‘s sight.'' thinks that the olive garland

But
the hair thus collected, and eontined by u
garland, would, it· kept beneath the helmet.
render it too large and loose, and if placed
above it would exhibit a ridiculous spec-
tacle.

Henry takes pressa (so premere falce—te
prune) as=recisa—“cropped,” and believes
that the hair was so cut as to resemble a
gnrland in its outer marein, which was
visible round the edge ofthe helmet. llis
arguments are as follows:—(l,) If Virgil
spoke of a real gai-land, he would have used
some epithet, such as olectyz'nect, or laurea
(2,) It would be a very odd expression tc
say that the gai-land pressed the hair, wher.
it only touched the helmet. (3,) In morem
is not a suitable phrase to be used of a gamo
celebrated fortho first time. Mox-cover, Sue-
tonius mentionsthat the Roman youths had
their hair cropped to resemble a garlund, in
the competition in this exercise. (4,) Since
Statius says ‹rm-1071 coronatum sor corona
aare«, Vireil might also say tonsam coronam
sor capillis ill sormam coronae detonsa.

557. Hostilia bina. Baebius Macer states
that the boys who engaged in the Trojun
gamos were presented by Augustus with
helmets and two spenrs each. To this tho

559. An ornate statement of the fuet that
each wore upon his neck a golden chain.
The chain was twisted (hence torques, from
torqueo) spirally {ind bent into a circular
form—it hung down from the neck on the
breast.

560. Wagn. and others write tres and not
tris, the common reading, which latter they
allege is found only in the accus. Tarni is
considered equal to tres in this place, having
lost its distributive force. For a very simi-
lar use of numerals, see above, 85.

On Turmae, and the divisione of the
Roman army generally, see Ramsay's
Antiq; and on bis seni, consult note, AEn.

562. Paribus Maqistrfis. The Ductores or
Custodes went here and there around the
field (vayamur), but besides these there was
a mayister (a kind of rubino master) to
super-intend the movements, and see that
no harm happened to the boys. Furious.

564. Referens is more than ferens, and
means “reminding men, by his name, of
his grandfather Priam.'⁷ On Polites, see
AEn. ii. 526.

565. Auctura Italos. Cato in his Orig.
says that Polites separated from AE1n·:1s
after his arrival in Italy, and founded the
