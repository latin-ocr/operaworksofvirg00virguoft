is used as a general epithet of the Styx, “a

426. Up to 540. we have a description of
the first part of the lower regions, and in it

sive, not on account of the multitude of oc-
cupants which they are intended to receive,
out in order that the ill—started lovers may
have in them that solitude which they de—
aare.

442, Quos. Some books read quas, on
