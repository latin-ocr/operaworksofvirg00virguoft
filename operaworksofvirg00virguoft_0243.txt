n slight inversic: goes on, cum clamore
revocabat.

170. Radit ‚cer—“cuts liis course;” so
217, radit iter liquzdzmu or the word mlerior
may lead us to suppose that it required
“close shaviny’· to get. past, and thus we
will translate literally “sompes'' Laevum—-
“on the left‚” keeping nearer the rock than
the Chimaera of Gyas.

A great many of the ideas in this des-
cription are taken from the gaines of the
circus and the mee-course, on which, con-
sult Ramsay⁷s Antiq., p. 347 sqq.

172. Ossibus is the dat. (not the abl. with
in omitted), and is, after the Greek fashion.

174. Decoris sui—‘⁵ inhonestum enim cst
irasci, praesertim duci.'' Serv.

Socizim salutis, scil. erepto yuberncttore
navis. This contracted form of the gen.
plur. of the ‘ld decl. seems to have been
used by all the ancient Roman writers: by
poets of the later years of the republio in
proper names (Arqivzim, Danazim, Rzztzcleim,
etc), and by prose writers of the same
period, in certain common formulae—in
uffan-s of religious and civil government
(dezim, ephordm. sabrzim, vio-itm, etc), and
ln the designations of weights, measures,
and coins. Forb.

176. Ipse rector, ipse mayister—the same
mea repeated, with emphasis3 for mayiseer
=9ubernator here.

178. Fando, i.e., α fundo. Gravis—inac-
tive in swirnming, partly by reason of his
age, and partly on account of the water
which his dress had imbibed.

179. Fluens in veste-an antique phrase
for fluens veste, and this latter for veste flu-
ente aqua.

181. The repetition of risere—rident of-
fended Heyne= so that he marked line 182
with an asterisk. But Wagn., Jahn, and
others defend it, by saying that tbe verbs
refer to different periods of time, and that
the sense is. “As they had laughec'. at him
when he fell from the boat and swam for
his life, so now they laugh at. him as he
emits the salt. water.”

183. Hic, i.e., hoo· ipso tempore—“Just at
this time,'’ or simply “upon this.''

184. λίηεείήεἰ, instead of the common
reading Mnestheo. Proper names in eus

poets aster the Greek fashion in the dat.
and acc. ei, ea, but. after the Latin model in
the gen. and abl. ei and co- Mor-antem,
“losing way.''

185. The interest of the contest now rests
between Sergestus and Mnestheus, the for-
mer of whom anticipates his rival in secur-
ing the inner course nearest to the rock

193. Ionio muri, i.e., after leaving Crete,
iii. 192 sq., 211 sqq„ where see note on
quantity of Ionius. To the same time is to
be referred the doubling of Cape Malea
(now St Angelm or Capo Mallo), on the
S. of Laconia. The waters are called
sequaces, either from the general appearance
of ware following wave, or because they
flow in so quick succession as to suggest the
idea. of an evil-intentioned purpose. The
(langers of the navigation round Malea are

recorded‘ in the Greek proverb. Μαλεάς
δὲ κάμψας ἐπιλάθου τῶν οἴκαδε, which
Erasmus, Adag., has translated Maleam
leyen-3, quae sunt domi obliviscere.

made by the oars causes the sea (which is
the solam, or surface traversed by the ships)
to yawn. “The sea plain is swept froin
neneath ‘thenis' an expression which ex-
actly suits the appearance presented under
vigorous rowing. Cf. note 162. above.

This and the line following are translated
