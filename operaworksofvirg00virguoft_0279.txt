Sabines, near the springs of the Allia, was
said to have been founded, along with Fi-
denae and Crustumerium, by three brothers
many years before the building of Rome.
Dion. Hal. ii. 53. Heyne numbers the colo-
nies of Alba Longa at thirty. Gabii, a
colony of Alba Longa, and situated be—
tween Rome and Praeneste. Fidenae, be-
tween Rome and Veii. The first syll. of the
word is usually long.

7 74. Collatia, a town of the Sabines in the
hills (hence its name), not far from Rome,
and lying between the road to Praeneste

780. Wagner thinks that we ought to
write viden, and such contractions, either
without an apostrophe entirely, or with two,
i.e., either viden, or vicle'n'. Mars is repre-
sented with a helmet having a double
plume, and so is his son, Romulus, in this
place.

781. Superum is taken by Senius as the
acc. sing. referring to Romulus, pater
meaning Mars, so that the sense would be,
‘⁴ Him, a god (one of the heavenly deities),
his father Mars already marks out with dis-
tinguished honourff' Ruddiman and others
take it as the gen, thus, “ His father (Mars)
marks him out with his own honours, i.e.,
1118 honours of deities,‘' a syntax which is
countenanced by the order of the words.
Others. again, make superam depend on
pater, i.e., Jupiter.

783. AEquabit is used in two senses, first
literally, and then figuratively. For animos,
Heumann conjectured annos as indicative
of duration.

785. Berecyntia, i. e.‚ Cybele, so called

she was carefully worshipped. Cybele was
represented with a mural erown (turrita),
