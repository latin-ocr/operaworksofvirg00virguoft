σῶμ’· 111 attendance on Neptune and other
marine deities. ‘rhe Greek form of the word,

’ΐό κῆτος, plur. *τὰ κήτη, is used by other

however, Roman writers employ the masc.

born at Anthedon: having eaten a cer-
tain herb, he conceived an uneontrollable
·desire. to precipitate himself into the sea,

certa was the son of Athamas and Ino, and
grandson of Cadmus; his mother. flying

of time, but 1110 sing. is employed when
several subjeets are supposed to perform
the same thing individually and 111 succes-
sion, each 111 1115 own time aud place, and
with his own exertion. In what manner,
nowever, the matter is viewed, and what
number, sing. or plun, is used, depends on
the judgment of the writer, whom (if he be
a poet) the necessities ofthe inetre or other
reasons may influencc in 1115 decision:
