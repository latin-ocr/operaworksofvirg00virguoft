which the spirits, before they return to life,
are fully restored to their first and native
condition. (3), Jahn is of opinion that,

above. With regard to the apparent cou-
tradiction in 745 to the statement of 744, we
think it is removed by the following ex—
planation. Virgil says that our souls= while
in the body, are polluted and corrupted, and
to remove the impurities then eontracted
severe peualties must be undergonc.. The.
stains being once removed, the soul is trans—
ferred to Elysium. that it may there pass
through a probationum( stage, and become
habituatecl to virtuous seeliugs, aud forge?
entirely its former sinful thoughts and ac-
110115. Elysium would, in this view of the
case, be a second, and finishing place of ,111111-
fication.

The following suggestion 15 wonhy' 01
consideration: we find it in Mr Galbrarth‘s
edition 01· our poet: “On many Etruscan
vases, as well as in the wonderful frescoe?
on their tombs. we find representations oso
‘guardian angel’ in white apparel, and with
looks benign, leading, as it were, 10 what ivl
right, and turning from what is wrong.
This is the bright and gay picture osactiv«
1110, 11111 1110 artist has depicted, also, scene.
beyond the death-honr, and 111011, 111 th«
majority of cases, 110 ‘guardian angel' ap-
pears: all is dark and gloomy, and besidfl
the ‹loomed one stands, not the blessed ad-
viser of an older time, but a dread arenger-⁸
armed with a gigantie mallet, and os inu
11101150 srame. Can it be that the ⁴ guardian
angel* becomes the ‘avenger,‘ that the ad.

the fell instrument ot' punishment sor error

recording angel closed the door of mercy3
and is his future *character indicated by his
name—⁴ the awaiter ?‘

Το 1110 11 appears that the perplexing pas-
sage under discussion might at least be
poetically explained by a. reference to this
Etruscan idea: ⁵ We each suffer the dread-
ful veneeanee of those beings who await
us:' of him who wan-ned us in life, and who
now exacts retribution in death. Γ1115 will
coincide with &Vagner's deliration (i.e., that

Manes is connected with μάω, μένος, μένω,
and is cognate with mem. the feeling, the
conscience of a human being), with the
vulgar interpretation (No. 1, above), and
