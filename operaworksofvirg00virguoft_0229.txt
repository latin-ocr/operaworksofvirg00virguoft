404. Jt aymam—et convectant. On 1110
variation in the number of these two verbs

lais moribus dabit nemo, i.e.‚ homini sic
morato—‘¹ to such a character.''

Fervet—“glows.'' This verb is used to
express aetivity ⁴‘and quick motion, since

419. Si potui—si=sa', or wenn in German.
and is to be translated, “Since 1 have beer
able to anticipate (sperare=e.rspectare). (see
298, omnia tuta timens) my present grief.
great as it is, I shall be able to bear it too*
423. Molles aditus et temporo, i.e.‚ you

“You alone knew the soft approaches to

424. Hostemzodiosum virum. *Hey‘ne
Thiel takes it as equal to hospitem, which
was the original signification of hostis.

426. Aulis, in Boeotia, where the Grecian
cineis, having assembled with their forces,
previous to their departure to Troy, bound
themselves by an oath not to return 1111
they had captured the city ofPriam.

427. Patris cinerem revelli. One of the
mos-t heinous of all sins, 111 the eyes of the
ancients. was to disturb the ashes of tho
dead. The poet, perhaps, makes reference
to the story that Diomede carried away the
ashes of Anchises, but afterwards returned
them to AEneas, when he had been plagued
sor violating and retaining them. This cir-
cumstance, however, could not have been
known to Dido at 1110 time, but the poet.
we have seen, does not avoid anachronisms,
11· the subJect be suited to embellish his work.

433. Tempus inane, i.e.‚ a scason during
which their relatiouship aud close intimacy
should be partiauy suspended, and an easy
transition made by her knowing merely
that Λ13110113, though not on terms of former
sriendship, was still near, and in Carthage.

435. reniam=gratiam„ beneficium.

to commentators‚ the opinions of some of
whom are enumerated underneath. (1,)
And if you confer this favour upon 1110, l

1105110, Jahn, andSiipfi. (2,) And if yon will
confer this favour upou me, you will testify
that it has been abundantly repaid at my
death, i.e.‚ that 1 have bestowed much more

Wagn.. who does not agree that morte means
during my lise until my death. (3,) Henry
reads cumulata, and, referring to the words
of AEneas, 360, Desine meque tuis incendere
teque querelis, explains as follows2—“1n
deference to the wish of AEneas, I shall cease
to 1130113- him with complaints and entreaties,
(i.e.‚ remittam—I shall slacken in my re-
monstrances), although liy his departure

sold (cumulata morte ).’“ (4‚) Forbiger inter-
