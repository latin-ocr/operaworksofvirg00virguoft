Ventos, i.e., secundos ventos.

44· El* “9927'3 This has reference t⁰ the chiscs) winingiy receive these sacrificial

earth raised in the camp.

45. Alto a sanquine, because Dardanus,
their progenitor, was son of ιῘονεῑς see iii.
167. Understand orcum after oenus,- a
particip. is often omitted thus, as at i. 16ος
ab alto for veniens ab alto.

47. Dirinique. The poets often place the
conj. que with a different word from that
to which it pro'perly belongs.

48. Mcestas. not by enallaqe sor moesti,
but to be applied properly to the altars as

49. W'agn. writes nisi for ni, because,
says he, ni Is used when one qffirms and
threatens determinedly (as AEn. ix. 805, xii.
568), nisi when one denies or doubts. The
cautionary expression nisi fallor is used,
since men in the most ancient times reckon-
ed by the return of the sun and planete
only, without any means of a nearer ap-
proximation to the very day and hour.

51. Hunc 290, etc, Wagn. and Heyne
put a comma aster eqo, thus making the
sentence an anacolouthon (see AEn. i. 237),
und considering ayeremr-essem, but Jahn,
’ Ρεθι·11(., Gossr., Forb., etc„ omit the point,
nnd govern hunc by ayerem, which has eyo
as its subject. This latter is manifestly
common sense, and, moreover, avoids an
unnecessary anacoloutlwn—anglice, “a blun-
εἷρπ’

Goetulzs syrtibus, i. e., Libyan, gene-
rally—for the Gaetuli, as we have seen,
lived to the W. Syrtes does not mean the
sandbanks, but the districts of the continent
hordering thereon.

52. Deprensus—“surprisedbytheeuemy ’²
Arqolico mari, i.e., the AEwean, the term
Amol-icus meaning anything Greek. My-
cenae is mentioned ns being the city of
Agamemnon, and therefore the head-qum·-
ters of enmity to the Trojan racc.

54. Altaria—“altars'' as if AEneas were
received into the list of deities. ’

55. Ultro means primax-ily “contrary to
expectationR’ Cfi'Livyi. 5, ultro accusan-
tes. See note ii. 145.

56. Equidem is said by some to be eom-
pounded of eqo quidem. Others, however,
resting on numerous examples in which it
'is joined to plur. nouns, and to words of
the second and third person, prefer to de-
duce it from e intensae (as &cas-tor, e-durus)
and quidem.

»Sine mente, without the intention (pre-
concerted plan). Sine numine. without the
wlsh. On numine, see note, AEn. i. 8.

66, Prima, i.e., primo Ioco, by enanaqe.
Although prima (i.e., primam) is used with
the first ot‘a series, we have not tum, deinde,
etc„ with the remaining particulurs os the
whole list. but the simple copulatives.

Ponam—⁴⁸1 shall institute.” The custom
of the ancient Greeks in celebrating games
on the death of a relative or friend is here
referred to. ᾧ

68. ,Ιαεαῖο and saqittis are rightly coupled
by the simple copulative que, since both
belong to the same kind of exercise, while
aut and sed conti-ast two different sorts of
game. ,laculo melior is similar in construe-
tion to optimus hasta, etc. The words
jaculo incedit melior are to be taken together,
as the verb incedere suggests a degree 01
confidence and pride arising from consciens
superiority.

69. Οναᾱο, ⁸‘untanned‚'' or so called from
the severity of the blows inflicted. The
former is to be preferred⁴

71. Favete ore, sommasfers—“Keep reli-
gious silence;'' so Hor. Od. iii. 1, 2, sin-ete
linquis. The phrase is well known as that
used by the priests at the commencement
of a sacred rite. Some read tempora emyite
ramis to avoid tempora ramis coming to-
gether, but. such alliterations are frequent:
see vii. 135, and viii. ⁶286. See note iii. 203.

72. The myrtle was naci-ed to Venus,
hence materna myrto.

73. Helymus had come from Troy to
Sicily with Acestes, as repert said. Aeni
maturus, ‘⁴ ripe in years.'' On the construc-
tion see AEn. i. 178, sessi rerum.

77 On these rites consult namsay, or
Smith's Dict. ofAntiq.·, and see AEn. iii. 66, 67.
Instead of Baccho, lacte, sanquine, we should
