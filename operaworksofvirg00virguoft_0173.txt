termination is, in a rhythmicul point of

Greeks3 others, however, following ancient
tradition, that Troy was taken about full
moon (see also 340, below), give to t'ne words
their most common acceptation. This mode
is much more poetic, and represents the
moon in a more distinctly personal aspect-
that she, “the eye of night.'' must have
seen the proceedings of Troy. enemies, but
yet preserved a silence which betokened
her favour to the Greeks. See 257.

sequence of tense in these verbs is found
fault with by some cmuinentators, but is
well defended by Forbiger as follows:—
