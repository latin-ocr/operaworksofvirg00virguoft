medes, descendant of Belus, and his renowu,
made glorious by fame, whom, under afalse
accusation of treason, the Greeks put. to
death, guiltless 'rnonGH 118 was of the in-
famous crime which was laid to his charge,
because he dissuaded them from war3 but
whom they lament now that he is dead: to
be a companion to him, related as I was to
him by blood, my father, a poor man, sent
1118 to the war at its very commeneements‘
Or, ‘⁵ In 1ny early years:'' But dulces natos
(138) opposes such an interpretation.
Laclewiq, h wever, prefers the latter mean-
ing, from t 8 circmnstances that (1,) Sinon
15 called juve111's‚· (2,) the words pueritia
and adolescentia had a wide extension3 and
(3,) dulces natos does not necessarily imply
great age.

82. Belides—patronymics from nouns in
us of the 2d dccl. have the penult short,
thus Priamides from Priamus-those from
nouns in eu. of the 311 decL, 01· from cles
have the pen 11t long, as Promethides from
Prometheus. In the word before us we have
0118 of the few exceptions to the rule. See
Priscian, ii. 7, 37. For the story of Paia-
medes, see Class. Dict.

85. Demisere neci—formed on the model
of such phrases as demittere Orc0, vmbris,

zeto, stgsqiae nocti, etc. Cf. Hom. ψυχὰς
Af& προΐαψεν.

SS. “So long as he (Palamedes) retained
his royal dignity undiminished, and pos-
sessed intluence iu the assemblies of the
(Greciau) princes, so long Ι too enjoyed,''
cte. This use of stabat in the sense of
“continuing prosperous'' is frequent. See
AEn. i. 26& Geo. iv. 209.

89. In Nomenque decusque some consider
a hendiaclys to be employedznominis decus,
but this is unsatisfacto1y; nomen seems to
im plyrenown, reputation, ant] decus, dignity,
consideration, influente.

90. Pellaeis—artful, zeheedlin'q, Some
copies read fallacis. On the gen. Ulioei see
Ποξῐὶῗ.ὶ”1ῗ3ἠιῖ symea, i.e., bene nota, by the
figure Litotes.

92. “ Distressed 111 mind I dragged on my
life in retirement and sorrow= aud iu soli-
tude (mecum) brooded over (bemoaned)
the unmerited disaster of my quiltless
friend.'¹ ν

95. Arqos used for all Greece, see 25,
55, 78. Euboea was his native place.
Heyne prefers αςινοε, as a private soldier
is spoken of—-hut iu the whole phrase
remeassem victor ad A.. though from the
mouth of a common ,soldier there is uo-
thing strange.

97. Hmc=exhac re. Labes—“plaque spot.”
A spot ou the sui-face indicative of disease.

πέλεν ἀρχή.
98. Terrere, sparqere, and quaerere m
so-called ‘⁴ historic infinitives.'‘

99. Conscius quaerere arma. On the
meaning of these words there is great di·
versity of opinion. In the first place, arma
is interpreted, (1) ‘⁴ counsels which Ulysses
devised to ward off the danger that threat,
cned him from Sinon;'’ or (2) treachery
and stratayems which he was prepeti-ing

‚to put in force against Sinon (as machinoe,

μηχαναί, τεύχεα, are sometimes used).
Secondly, conscius is understood to mean
either, (1) couscious of the danger that
threatened himself; or (2) being] an accom-
plice, i.e., having assumed to himself ac-
complices, eg. Calchas—see below, 267—
[thus Heyne and Wagner]; or (3) conscious
ot· the act of injustice he had perpetrated
against Palamedes. Forbiger would trau
slate as follows: “And eonscious of (or-
conscius being often used absolutely 111 a bad
sense—conscience-smitten by) his act of in-
justice (to Palamedes) sought the help
(drma=operd771) of others.'’

100. Enim (cf. the use of γάρ iu Greek)
seems to refer to a suppressed clause which
may thus be supplied: Thut I am right 111
asserting that Ulysses used all means for
my destruction is evident—“for he did not
rest till,'' etc. For the sudden break off
(aposiopesis) at inires-tro, ef. AEn. i. 135,
quos eqo-secl, etc

101. Sed autem—the combination of these
particles, though frequent among comio
writers, is found nowhere else in Virgil.
WVagner and others consider it equal to
tandem. But it seems rather to be used for
the purpose of contrasting his own feeling!
on these painful subjects with the indiffer-
ence which might naturally be expectet³
to exist among the Trojans concerning
them, which, indeed, the rest of the line
implies.

Nequidquam and frustra differ in this,
that flustra refers to the sulyect and the dis-
appointment of his expectationdneqaeidquam
to the “numm'’ in which a thing ends.
See Doderl. Lat. Syn. Note the difference
between quid revolvo and quid revolvam,
and see Madvig, ξ 353.

Inqrata — objectu-ely,
will not thank me.'‘

102. Quidve moror—there is in common
editions a note of interrogation after these
words; but Wagner and Forbiger place a
comma merely, and indicate the question
after sat θείς jamdudum s. p. forming a
separate clause, connected in sense with
what follows. Ou uno ordine habetis,
cf. 64. ι
