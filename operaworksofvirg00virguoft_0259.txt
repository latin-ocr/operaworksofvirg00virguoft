ARGUMENT.

AENEAS having lauded at Cumae immediately seeks the cave of the Sibyl, and consults
the oracle: from it he learns sorno particulars of his dangers and further labours (1-155).
He performs funeral rites to the body of Misenus; and while engaged in the preparations
for this ceremony discovers the golden bough, which, as a gift to Proserpina. would
gain for 111111 permission to pass to the Elysiam shades, to meet and converso with his father
