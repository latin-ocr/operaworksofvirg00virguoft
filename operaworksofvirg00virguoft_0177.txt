lt ls called by the grammarians, υσφεραν
rste-spor, that is, in plain English, “the
cart before the horsc;'' or. to use our own
English ter111,p1·eposterous. The figure (so-

· called) is a mere fiction arising from a
careless examination of the suu force of
a phrase. and the consequent sailing to
dctect a bcauty. To tukc'this example;
who does not see that the second phrase
tends to heighten the first, as if he said,
“Let us die—ay, any coward can do that
—nay, rather let. us court death by rush-
ing to meet him.”
worth's sonnets on the French campaign
in Russia, in 1812-13, thcrc occurs the
phrase—

thole legions sink—and, in one instant,
Burisrlzlllgnd death.

This is not hysteron-proteron, bnt an mrfully
faithful picture of the suddenness of destruc-
tion—the bnrial almost preceding death.

355. The comparison of men to wolves is
osten employed by Homer. See Il. xi. 72;
xvi. 156, 353.

358. Per tela, per hostes. The repetition
ot* the prepos. instead of a conl. is often
employed by poets and orators with sin-
gular force and beauty. Such an orna-
mental repetition is, however, to be caret'ully
distinguished from that which ismade by
all writers when the governed words do not
refer to the same thing.

360. Caeci—this adj. is applied to many
nouns which denote uns.;bsta11tial, or va-
poury objects, eg.. nor, nubes, immJo, um-
bra. etc. The idea is derived from the
facility with which they envelop substantia]
matter, and snit themselves to all shapes.

This line has been brought t‘orward by
smne crities (lVagncr) as' an instance ot*
similius dormitans, on the ground that it is
inconsistent with340,0blatiperlunam. Thiel.
however, defends virgil by supposing (1),
that he speaks of such a period of the inoon’s
age as would imply that she set about mid-
night; and (2), that therefore the first affi-
val οἰ the Greeks. and the collecting ot' the
Trojans, was etl‘cctcd under her light, and
that thc second act ot* the great tragedy
which begins with this line was performed
in the darkness and glomn which continued
up to the time of 501. But to this it is
objectod (1), that a tradition existed that
Troy was taken at full moon, when a mid-
night setting is impossible3 and (2), that
it' the m'ght was dark during the latter
part ot* it, the change of armonr at 389
would have been unnecessary. Forbiger

etc., that the darkness was not such aa
397 and some other verses would seem tc
allege. Why may we not then imagine it
one of these blustering and sumen-hat
stormy nights. when clouds driven by the
wind (see 758) occasionally obscure the
moon‘s disc? The change from clear to
cloudy sky, from bright light to interrupted.
and dim blinks οἳ moonshine, will well
represent the sad alteration which had taken
place on the fortune ot* Troy. A few honrs
ago and she was lnlled in security and sup-
posed safety—her moon riding high in a
now cloudless sky —when suddenly her
firnnunent is orei-cast, and though rays ot
hope oecasionally break through the gloom.
yet she cannot bnt feel that the honr of
darkness and dismay has come.
