meaning in this place not the lake, but the
regions of the dead. Several copies read
Averni, which Wagner belleves to have
arisen from some grammarians who did not

scendo) are frequently construed in the same
way as the verbs from which they are
formed.

129. AEquus, i.e., promtius—‘² Jupiter in

131. Tenent media * * atro. These words
are found fault with by Wagner, as implying
an absurdity3 the things, he says, which
make cyress diffieult, render inqress equally
irKsome and laborious; nor is thore any
evident reason why one should find it
impossible to return by the way through
which he entered. In reply to this, Peerlk.
says, “Imagine a subterranean labyrinth.
The mouth is wide—there is at first no
darkness—the light of day follows the tra-
veller for some distance down the tunnel.
The ways-rer, however, gets gradually
benighted amidst windings of the path,
woods, and meandering rivers, so that he
finds it impossible to retrace his»steps.'' The
mention of silvae is suggested by the woods
surrounding LakerAvernus.

159. Fiyz't vestzqia is more than ponere
vestiqia, since the former signifies to walk
slowly and steadily, as if engaged in reflec-
tion.

160. Heyne pronounces virgil to have
been “nodding' here, in that he forgets the
recent death of Palinurus, when he represents
AEneas as in difficulty to discover whose

172. It was a mythic way of denoting ex-
cellence in au individual, that he who was

Apollo, and Arachne with Minerva.
