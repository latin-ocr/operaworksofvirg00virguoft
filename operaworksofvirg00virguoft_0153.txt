also 784, lacrimas dilectae, pelle CreiiStze.
The< Latin genitive is either sulgl'ectt're or
affective—thus, in the phrase amor (lei, it is
subjective when it means the love which God
(as the subject) seels towards inan ; it is ob-
jective when it denotes the love which man
directs to God (as the olgiect loved). The
objective qen. is, therefore, equal to an accus.
with a preposition.

463. Tibi—another example of the Dalii-us
Ethicus. See 261, above. With a strouq
feelinq of kindness he applics te Achates

464. Inani—‘⁴unsubstantial ''—so called,
because representing only the outline

466. The seven groups represented are as
follows:—l. The battle of the Trojuns and
Greeks, with varying fortune, 467-8. 2.
The death of Rhesus, 469 sqq. 3. Troilus
in ssight, 474 sqq. 4. The processioa of
TroJan matrons carrying the robe for pre-
sentation to Minerva, 479 sqq. 5. Priam
redeeming the body of Hector, 483 sqq. 6.
The battle by Memnon and his host, 489. 7.
'l'he battle of the Amazous, 490 sqq. Heyne.

467. The battle referred to is that in
which Patroclus was siaiu (Hom. Il. xxii),
nster which Achilles carne forth on the fol-
lowing day, Il. xix„ xxii.

468. Heio—Hac, sorHac—illac. On Rhe-
5115, see Hom Il. x. 4313 sqq„ 470 sqq. .

469. Niveis tentoria velis. This is an ana·-
chronism similar to that noticed in 169,
in reference to (mclzors. The Greeian and
'rrojan ⁴⁴ tents ¹* were rather huis made with

against both schemes, he advances a third,
'rhat all matters relating to lise. public or
private, sacred or profane, 'nave been
treated by Virgil in the AEneid in conso-
nanee with Roman notivns, and that. his
ideas were derived partly from the state ot
the city and empire in his own day, and
partly from the traditions of customs or
doctrines which prevassed in tne infaney, or
during ,τι-51111111 growth of the nation. A care-
ful study of Dr Lersch's arguments cannot
faivae should think, to convince the student.
that this last is the only tenable theory.
But we must refer the render to the works
themselves, as the length of the discussion
prcchules the possibility of our epitomising
it here. Rhesus was king of Thrace, and
brother of Hecuba, wife of Priam.

4723. The prophecy was, that it' the 1101505
of Rhesus should taste the fodder of Troy,
and 111-11111 of the Xanthus (otherwise called
Scamander), Troy would be invincible.
111-5505 and Diomede, therefore, attacked
the encainpmcnt ot' Rhesus and his Thra-
cians, killed the leader and carried off his
ligi-scs. Homer does not mention this pro-
p ecy.

474. Troilus—youngest son ofPriam. See
11. xxiv. 257.

475. Impar conqresszts — ‘⁴ an¹ unequal
match.”

416. Inani, i.e., rectore Ρνίυαὲο, “deprived
os its chal-ioteer.''

ened by arsis, and 500 note on 308, above,
and on Ecl. vt 53. “The mould is scratched

Latin writers, and almost limited to denote,

A perf. part. pass. is frequently used 111
poetry for a pres. pass.. which does not exist.
Hence it happens that the poets write perf.
pffl'tlclps. even m those cases (viz. in depo—
