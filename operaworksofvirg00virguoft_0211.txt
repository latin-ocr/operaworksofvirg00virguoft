the irregular cui-rents. the sudden rising ot*
the water, and the upheaving of the saud.

556. Voces, scil. maris, fractas ad litora,
i.e., “of the waves breaking on the shore
with a loud roaring noise.'’

558. N imirum does not here implyderision
or irony, but is equal to sine dubio, “of a
truth.''

Haec illa—“this that we now see, is that
Charybdis which Helenus formerly spoke
of.”‘ The words in italics indicate the
peculiar force of the pronouns haec and {lla

is hugely indebted to Lucretius, vi, 696Ι

572. Prorumpit, in an act. sense, “dis-
char-gesy· “casts forth.'' The measure ot
these lines, and the frequent repetition ot
tho letters 7· and t, have been remarked as
particularly well suited to add to the horror
of the scene. In Homer's time there (locs
not seem to have been an eruption of IEtna,
but the mention of the Cyclopes' caves
seems to imply that some had previously
occurred. Pindar is the first writer to
mention distinctly an eruption of the moun-
tain. In Virgil's time several took place—
in the years B.C. 49, 44, 38.

the mouth of some monster which had been
struck with lightning, and buried beneath

as the buried giants. '
