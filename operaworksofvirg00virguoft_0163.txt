ARGsJMENT.

AExzas, in oompliance with Dido's request, details the particulam of the capture of Troy,
so far as he had witnessed them. After expressing reluctance to fight his disagreeable
battles over again, the hero goes on to teu of the despondency of the Greeks in the tenth
year of the war, together with their stratagem of the horse. Lurking in Tenedos, they
send a cunning fessow, Sinon, to prepare the way for the reception of the wooden horse,
