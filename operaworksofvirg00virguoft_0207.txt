sonantia silvis—“sounding amidst the
πνοοᾱε]7 Tho epithet is transferred to
Averna, instead of being applied to the
woods, for as a lake is spoken of and not a
river, the more natural sense would bc,
“Avernus among the sounding κνοοᾱε.Η
The lake is called in Geo. iv. 493, Averna
stanna, and the idea is that of a dark and
stiu sheet of water, exhaling pestilentia]
vapours from its putrid surface, notions
quite opposed to sowzclz'nq billows and
nnoving waves.

443. Insanam, i.e.‚ “ins1]h⁴ed,'' plenam
cleo. Sub ima rupe, ie„ in the eave.

444. Notas, i.e., literas‚· nomina, i.e.,
verba. Instead of the two finite verbs,
canz't and mandat, coupled by a conj., wc
should rather expect the particip. ot* the
one and the indic. of the other. This suble

the Sibylline hook-³⁴

453. Dispendc'zmz, which is the opposite of
compendium, is properly (1) “expense'' (2)
“damage,'' (3) “loss‚'' Morameans tnnc,
which is wasted by delay (morando). The
sense, therefore, is, ‘⁶ Let not the loss of time,
however much, bc to you a matter of so
great consequence * * as to prevent you
from approaching the prophetcss,'' etc.

4541. Increpitare means either to ronse to

a favom‘ing breeze.

457. Ipsa canat—“ request that she sing,”
or “le⁴ her of her own accord, aud at her
own pleasure, sing,'' which sense of desit-ingr

stood.

Sibyl may be read at ΕΠ. vi„ 83 sqq.

the priests prophesied.
