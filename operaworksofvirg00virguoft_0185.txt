Anchises,

596. Non is herc used for nonne, but it is
more emphatic and forcible. The future is
used in negative questions, which at the
sau-,e time serve as exhortations.

Adspicere is used by the pects as equal to
circumspicere, invisere, anquirere.

597. Szzperct=szzperstes sit. Ne should be
Loined to superet rather than to conjur.

598. Quos—circum· for a similar separa-
tion ofprep. and case, see above, 2²78.

599. Resistac — tulerint— hauserit. The
variety ot* tense is worthy ot' notice. The
words are not put for restitisset, tulissent,
and hausisset, but arc designcdly used to
express that the care of Venus is still cx-
ercised, even while they are speaking, and
that there is still danger, as there lias 110011
for some time past, ot* the szcorcl drz'nlclnss
tlzet'r blood. Om· English idioni, rcquiring
pust tenses in hypotheses, has led some
commentators astray.

601. Tibi must depcnd on evertit, as the
Dativus incommodi, and not on inrisa, as
thus invisa will 110 111010 sorcible, and the
hatred will be made to appear more qeneral.
⁸⁸ It is not the hated 11015011 of the Laconian
Tyndaris (Helen), nor is it the much—
blamed Paris, (but) it is the unrelenting
decrees of the gods, of the gods Ι say, that
have overthrown for you this kingdom, and
that are now levelling Troy from its highest
pinnacle.''

602. Cf. Hom. 11. iii. 164. Callemus, “the
blamed Pans' = scelestus, as calpa some-
times = scelus The repetition of dictim
(anaphora) gives a tone of peculiar solem-
nity to the intimation. Some books would
spoil the beauty os the passage by substi-
tnting verum sor the first divam, in which
the secret agents in the accomplishment of
2¹1⁰ great event are presented to the view ot'

neas.

604. The following passage is particularly
beautiful. It is based partly 011 Ηο111. Il.
v. 127, xii. 113 sqq., *27 sqq., and partly on
the descriptions of other poets. To 111-011*
away AEneas from the danger of the fight,
t> lead him to save his own family, and at
the same time to preserve Helen, who had
ever been her favourite, Venus opens the
eyes of her 501110 behold the heavenly mes-
sengers‚ and convinces him thercby of the
111101 inutility of resistance. By this device
nt* divine interposition, the poet savcs the
character ot‘ his hero.

606. Caliqat. This verb, which usually
means visus calzqine laborare, caecutire, (to be
blind, used of a person), is here equal to 01111ᾳί-
nosum esse (to be full of darkness). Some
take it 05 transitive, “blinds you.'‘ Heyne
objeets to this and the next line, as being
parum commode interposita-4 But Wagner

the real state of matters, sie might at oncss

609. Unclantem. This word is often ap-
plied to 0500111ἰίος flame and smolce, from
the resemblance which they present to the
successive surges of the sea.

610.·Tr1·‹lent1'. Some books read tridente,

Neptunus. Cf. Hom. n. xii. 27 sqq. The
enniity of Neptune 10 1110 Trojans is said to
have been caused by the refusal of'Laome-
don to pay to him and Apollo 1110 stipulated
sum sor their labonrs in rearing the walls
of Troy. An attempt has been made to
explain this story, by saying that since the
temples in ancient times were so many
bani-s for the deposit and sat'e 1100111119,- of
treasnres, Laomedon (i.e., the ruler of the
people) had borrowed from the temples of
Apollo and Neptune the amount of gold
necessary for the expenses of his fortifica-
tions, but had failed 10 repay the debt, and
hence his calamities. Sec thford, Hist. ot*
Grecce, vol. i., p. 104.

611. Totamque—que is equal to “nam'’

612. Τ110 Scaean gates looked to tho
Grecian encampment and the sea—hence
they were much exposed, and are most:
frequently mentioned. Troy had five other
gates. Saevissinm, “most savage of 0]1“’
(1110 gods).

613. ι10111 furens with vocat, and thus the
second particip. accincta, 1111110111 a copula,
will not be obJectionablc. ‘⁵ With her swerd
girt on, 5111111110115 111 frantie haste her allied
band from the ships.''

616. Nimbo. This must have been a
dark cloud, since the goddess was unpro-
pitious, but it became red and glai-hig by
means of the light from the flames of burn-
ing Troy playing upon it. Consult the
Classical Dict. on Minerva and the Gor-
gons.

617. Ipse Pater, ie.. Jupiter. Vires secun-
daS, i.c., assistance which shall produce a
favourable issue. Sufficit is here transitive,
‘⁵ supplies plentifully.’¹

619. Eripe faloam. Since, from the en-
tire ruin of the city. you can rescue nothing
else, scize upon ssight at least, ie, the
power of escaping. Jahn.

625. Ilium—Troja. The repetition of the
most prominent noun has a peculiar force
and pathos.
