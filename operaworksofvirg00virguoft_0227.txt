which we have joined 'm hospitality. On waizclerer.

318. Domus labentis—cle qente Didonis in-
telliyendum, vel potius de Didone ipsa, quae
hic novam qenlem reyz'am conditura est.
Forbiger.

320. Havmg reterred to personal favours
and private considerations, she now turns
to the troubles and difficulties which AEneas
had brought οη her, and which he can alle-
viate, or remove, by remaining at. Car-
thage.

Nomadum tyranni—“kings of the Numi-
dians:'' Iarbas is particularly meant. The
name Numidae, Sallust, Jug. 18, derives
from Nomades. ie, the shepherds—pastoral

tribes, from νθμὸς- Numidia is called No-
mas by MartiaL

321. lnfensa‘ Tyrii. Either Tyrian nobles
had been rejected when seeking her hand,
or the general body of the people were dis-
satisfied that they are made subject to
AEneas, a foreigner.

323. Cui deseris me-shortly for cui relin-
quens me deseris. immolandam, i.e.‚ morit-
turam pei· le.

324. [sospes—7200 nomen cle comae-How
much bitterness of reproof do these words
convey! Cf. ii. 678.

325. Quid moror. These words have
reference to moribundam, 323. The mean-
ing is. ‘⁴ If 1 am to die, why do I delay to lay
hands on myselx before Iarbas or others of
my enemies destroy me *Γ* After an supply
moror from the foregoing.

326. Gaetulus is put for Aser generally,
since Iarbas was king of the Muxitani, and
not of the Gaetuliam, as we have seen.

327. Suscepto fuisset. This verb usually
applies to the aet of arfather in taking up his
children, in token of his wish that they
should not be exposed, but saved. It thus
means to rear, to educate. and is not to be
confounded here with concipere. Cf. Ter.
Andr. ii. 3, 27.

330. Capta ac deserta is a strong phrase for
“abandoned by you.'' Capta is supposed by
some to have reference to the dreaded cap-
tivity by Iarbas, but this seems quite irre-
concilable with the foregoing lines. Gossr.,
finding the difficulty of capta insurmountable,
rejects 526-30 altogether. Capta, however⁹
seems to mean “taken in‚'' “outwittedst'
“ deceived.”

332. Curam, i.c., dolorem.

335. Prome-ziam, scil. <le me, that is,
you have conferred many favours on me.

Elissa, or Elisa, was the proper name of

336. Reqit—the common reading is reyel.
On this VVagn. remarks that dum with the

fut. signifies continuanee of time, without
but team and any limit being assigned; but with the pre-

sent it denotes all the time that elapsos up

-Ι Eo tclile end of a period whose duration is
xe .

337. Pro re=pro re ηαια, ie, considerlng
the state of affairs. Furtum. is anything·
don„ in s clandestine manner; the idea of
“a desire io deceive· being necessarily im-
plied.

339. Praetendz laedas, i.e., I have never
put the name of marriage on our relatlon-
ship.

Ilaecfoeclera, “such engagements‚'' viz„
as those of marriage. Aul after nec becomes .
negative.

341. Meis auspiciis. These words are sel-
dom employed in reference to the affairs of
an individual ,- the signification is trans-
ferred from publio matters, more especially
from the consuls and generals of the armies,
qui aut suis aul alienis auspiciis res qerunt.
The lise of AEneas was hereafter to be regu-
lated according to the will of the gods or
the Fates, and therefore alienis auspiciis.

34⁴2. Urbem Trojanam colerem, ie.. “1
should have built a new city on the ruins of
ancient Troy, and now be inlzubitinq it,
taking a delight in paying yearly honours
to the Manes of my friends.'' Reliquias,
the Manes, as translatmh not the sepau-lires,
which is Heyne's opinion. Wagner under-
stands it as the city icself. The variety oi
tense in colerem and posuissem will be easily
explained. There is a zethma in colerem
which is applied to reliquias and urbem in
different senses.

344. Manu, pleonastically‚ as is often the
ease when words of art and industry are
spoken of. So ore or voce after verbs of
speaking.

345. Grynium, or Grynia, was a town of
