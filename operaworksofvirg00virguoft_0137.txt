Oilei, Le.,fili1‚ understood, as often. But
⁷ instead of Oilicles we have Ajaoe Oileus.

42. Ipsa—“she in person,'' without re-
quiring to eall in the help of any other
power. laculata--this verb is usually em-
ployed in reference. to the thunderbolt, as
well expressing, by the sound, the vehe-
mence of the action.

42-45. Rau, in Schedzasm.. pronounees
these four verses to be interpolations by a
recent hand. He thinks their “Traqicus
intuor '' foreign to the passage.

413. Ditv‘ecic rates-see below, 123 and

forth the iightuing 111-85 many and frequent‘'
—sttch is the force of the Pluuflammas.

45. Infizit—some books have inflirit. But
the best MSS. exhibit the common reading,
and, besides, the former verb is most appli-
cablc to the phrase acuto scopulo.

46. Ast—this ancient form of the particle
suits well the dignity or' the passage. Cf.
Hand. Turseli, i. p.417. Die-om, poetic form
for dicum. Incede—“welk maiesticallyl'

Tot annos—ace. of duration ostime. The
abl. would signify nn interval. Bella ρει-ο
—wage a lengthened war, in eontrast to the
single blow of Athene.

48. Quisquam is used because <Iuno im-
plies by her question that she expects a
negative reply. Junom‘s numen—rather than

me. By the use of the proper name instead,

of the personal pronouns much more em-
phasis and force are given to the sentence.
Cf. ii. 79, 549, 674. Bella yero-Observe
the venom in the phrase. implying that
though she ought to be looked upon as their
superior, yet she is obliged to fight on con-
tinually as their equal. The whole speech
is admirably eonstructed.

49. Adorat—imponet. The differenee of
tense in these words has given rise to dis-
cussion and emendation, some reading
adoret—imponat. There is, however, no
necessity for any change. The indicative
expresses wonder or indiqnation-aud here
signifies that Juno will be astonished should
men still continue to pay her homage. The
subjunctive, on the contrary, would express
doubt, and denote that Juno source believed
that. she would be worshipped by any here-
aster. Praeterea adorat=aclorabit: Prae-
terea refers to time, “hereafter,” *⁴ any
longer.'' For a similar indignant speech of
Juno, see Ovid Met. ii. 518 sqq.

50. without a hint of the intentions ot’
the goddess, we are at once carried on to
her decisive acts in pursuanee ot* her object.
Cf. Hom. 11. xiv. *233 sqq.

51. Loca—Observe this plur. in opposi-
tion to a singular: for a similar construe-
tion. see AEn. v. 359

· 52². Aeoliam—Virga and Homer speak 01
only om> island, bnt the group consists of a
considerable number, 9 or 10, which eon-
stitute the modern Lipari isles N. ot* Sicily.
The one referred to in the text is supposed
to be Lipara (Lipari), cr Strongyle (5110111-
boli). The islands were called Aeoliae„
Aeolides, Hephaestiades‚ or Vulcaniae—the
two latteruames expressive of the ancient
belief that in one os thern, Hiera, Vulean,
the tire-god, had his forge. The relation that
subsisted between storms and the outburst-
ing offire from the earth led to the fancy that
the volcanie group of the Lipari, which sup-
plied the “lighthouse ofthe Mediterranean, ''
was the place where storms were gene-
rated. With Virgil's description compare
nom. Od. x., at the beginning. Aeolus, son
01' Hippotes, whose meteorological know-
ledge excecded that os the rude inhabitants
ot‘ the islauds under bis authority, received,
iu later times (though not in Homer), the
appellation of ⁴* King ofthe Windsf

sound os the words to 1118 sense eonveycd,
is osten observable iu Homer, and has been
very snccesssully attempted hy virgil in
many places. This line, 53, is au example
of it. Everyxvord is selected with care, and
placed with remarkable suitableuess, so
that the numbers aud rhythm combine with
1118 vocables to express the struggling ef
the winds and the roaring of the howling
blasts. Observe the spondeos. Many in-
stances of this artificia] versification may be
seen in our own poem, more especially
Drydcn and Pope.

55 Cum murmure, i.e., ita ut murmuret.

Xoli euim de

,Cum is used to express 1118 mode in which

a thing* takes place, but the abl. aione also
‹lenotes this. Montis is governcd by mur-
mure, and not by claustra.

513, Celsa arce—These words are coni·
inonly interpreted as meaning “the high
summit of the mountain,'' which, in 140,
is called alda. Dr Henry (Class, Mus. vol.
vi.) understands then] to mean (ιη exaltent
Tur-oxu within the care itself. This view,
says Forb., would render the explanation os
81 sqq. much easier, and would be better
suited to 140, bnt we want example5 of
(τι-,τ similarly used Dr Henry is of opinion
that the winds are in this passage compared
to the horses continet] within the bari-iers
of the Circus, and engerly strix-ing to break
forth. Yery many words in the passage ⁸
bear out this idea, e. g. vinclis, carcere, frenat,
mollit animos, temperat iras. ete.⁷ though it
must be confessed that objections may be
urged against it. Dr Henry's remarks are
well worthy of attention.
