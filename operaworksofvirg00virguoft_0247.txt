326. Ambiquum is taken by Heyne as

334. Amorum—‘⁴ of his affcction,’' not

336. Arena. Wagner remarks that Virgil,
thinking of the circus at Rome, which was
covered with saud ou such occasions as this,
here forgets what he had said in 287 aud 330.
We ‹lo not, however, see that the poet is to
be hastily condemned. Though the plain
was grassy (287) on the whole, yet we may
easily imagine that the concourse of people
at the gamos, and the struggles of the vic-
tims as they were slaughtered, together
with the bustling tread of those engaged in
sacrifieing, may have worn away the her-
hage, and left the soil exposed. The use
of liumus in 330, as opposed to herbas, would
lead us to a. similar conclusion. And it
may be further argued that spissus is em-
ployed purposely, to save the poet from the
charge which he may have himself antici-
pated by the use cf arena alone. We
would, therefore, suggest that spissa arena
means the Ioose would, which was their only
substitute for sand, but which (the poet ao-
knowledges) was spissus at the best. Spissius
means dense, ie, with little space between
the component particles of a body, an idea
which suits well with heavy mould, the in-
dividuality of whose atoms is not so easily
discovered. or so generally recognised as that
of the qrains of saud. For arena, meaning
·‘ mould‚'’ see Geo. i. 1053 ii. 2323 iv. 291.
Observe the tense of jacuit, expressive
