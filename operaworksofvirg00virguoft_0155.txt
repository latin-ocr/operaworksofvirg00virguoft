their ships 011 the shore. Clamore, i.e.,
with the shout of her attendinq crowd.

520. Maximus. scil. natu, “the eldest,'⁷
and therefore highest in command. Placido
implies calmness and diqm'ty of address.

“ Thou to whom Jupiter has proved so kind
wilt not fail to assist the wretched. Thou
to whom he has entrusted the dispensing
of justice to thy subjects‚ wilt not be unjust
to foreigners. Thou who hast planted the
sceds of civilization in a barbarous land,
wilt not show thyself inhumari and unmer-
eiful.'' Gossrau.

523. Dedit condere—see above, 66 and 319.

Superbas orentes, Le„ the Africam, Jus-

526. Pio ρεπεν-ἰ, i.e., harmiess, unoffend-

ut plunder, or other injury. It may be
used, however, with reference to thc race
os which the Pms AEneas was chief.

Propius adspice—‘⁴ look more narrowly
into our affairs,‘' i. e., do not judge us by
our first appearance.

527. Populare depends on Venimus in the
infin. instead of being put in the subj. with
ut. This isin imitation of the Greek con-
struction. Verbs of yoz'ngy,v cominq, and
sending] are frequently thus used. The verb
populari is used of a place deprived of its
inhabitants, while populare in the active
voice means to slay the people as a preludo
to plunder. Livy, Ovid, and some few more
use this verb in the aet. voice, but other
writers of the Augustan age, and those
which followed them, prefer it as a deponent.

530. Locus for reqio. Hesperia (i.e., a
western land) is used by the ancients in re-
{ard both to Italy and Spain (Hor. Od. i.

6, 4).

531. Potens armis, etc. “Powefful by

534. Hic cursus fuit. Hic is the reading
of most MSS„ and is adopted by VVagucr,
Foru, etc, instead of the vulgar one huc.
The demonstrative pron. frequently per-
forms the part of an adj. of place.

On deficient lines, generally, in the
AEneid, see Forbiger in h. loc.

536. Assurqens. This word properly ap-
plied to the sea itself is here attributed to
the constellation whose rising and settgig

Cum, when used in connecting a. result,
suggests the. idea of very preat rapidity in
the sequence, and also of semprz‘se and una
expectedness. Cf. iii. 301.

539. Hominum. After this word Heync
places a comma, but Wagn. and Forh a
note of interrogation, by which quod is
made the important word, and rendered
equa] to quamserum et inhumanum.

543. sperate, i.e.‚ metuite. Fundi et ne-
Observe atque
coupliug things of a contrary kind.

545. Pietate is commonly made to de-
pend on justior, which gives a very harsh
meaning. It is better to punctuate after
alter, connecting pietate with major, and
translating, “Nor was any one more dis-
tinguished sor moral virtue (piem-s· ema deos
et parentes), or for skill as a leader (bello),
or for personal prowess (armis):'’ a nega-
tive is to be supplied to justior from what
follows.

546. Aru-⁶2. W'hen Virgil speaks of the
atmosphere, he almost invariably uses the
plural —the singular is preferred here
(Wagn. Quaest. Virg. 9) for the sake of
sound merely, to prevent three successive
{ixsses from terminating in the same *syl-
a le

547. Umbris is not³the dat.=occumbere
morti (ii. 62), but the abl. equal to in
umbris. Umbris means orcus, and to the
former word is applied the epithet (crudelis)
which usually characterises the latter. Cf.
Hom. Od. xx. 207, and Hor. Od. ii. 3 24,
Victima ΧΠ, ΜῙΞΕΕΑΝΤΙΞ orci.

548. Ne-the usual reading is nec, but the
best recent commentators adopt ne as more
suited to the context.

550. Arvaque is preferred by Heyne and
others to armaque, since the latter is incon1
sistent with the peaceful and mild character
of the rest of the address, and a threat would
be here out of place, and since, in the second
place, it suggests that Sicily is. a more de-
sirable place sor seulement, und that therc-
