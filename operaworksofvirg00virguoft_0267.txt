13. VI. 311-333.

311. Friyidus annus—“the cold season of
the year, ie„ winter.” So “pomifer annus-‚¹¹
‘⁵ the apple-bearing part of the year,” ie..
autumn. Burm. reads amnis instead of cm-
mes, and would refer it to the Strymon, on
whose banks immense fiocks of cranes as-
fembled previous to their departure for

313. orantes transmittere, ie„ nt sibi laceat
transmittere. The infin. aster verbs of desir-
in9, lonqinq, askiny, etc., usually refers to
him who is asked to do something, but here,
and in Eel. ii. 43, it refers to hIm who begs
to be allowed to do something. Examples
ofthis construction are very rare. See ix. 231.

314. Amore, i.e., desederzo— ‘⁵ longing.''
Having this place in view, Quinet. calls
life after death, seatio ulteriores ripae.

316. Arce! submotos, ie„ by a kind of
hysteron proteron, “removes aud keeps
off.” Cf. AEn. ii. 353.

320. Lirzqzmnt ripfls, viz.. aster being re-
fused admittance to the boat.

321. Olli—antique form: see AEu. i. 254.
Lonyaeva—the story is, that Apollo, being
enamoured of the Sibyl, granted her to live
as many years, as the grains of saud num-
bered which she could take up iu her hand ¹
at one grasp.

322. vertissem—‘⁴ most undoubted,'' if
we may be allowed such a superlative. The
liberty of visiting the infernal regions was,
we saw in 130, a proof os divine orig-in.

Betim—a plur. for sing, as in AEn. 1. 4,
where see note. Venus is meant.

324. Jurctre ee fallere. Critics detect a
hendiadys (see iii. 148) iu this place, which
they say is for peierare, but such an ex-
planation is not only uunecessary, but, in our
opinion, it weakens the force of the expres-
sion.

325 Inops—“helpless.” No one will per-
form funeral rites to *them on earth.

327. Datur, scil. Charonti.

330. Admissi revisunt—they are admitted
to the boat ou their return, and thus reach
the wished-for shore.

334. Leucaspim—this is the favourite form
of the acc. of such words with Virgil; he
uses tn (Daphnin) in only one passage, EeL
v. 52, and there he is compelled by the ne-
cessity of the metre.

Orontes—he whose death was recorded in
AEn. i. 113, where, however, Leucaspis is
not mentioned.

337. Peerlk. considers the whole passage
to 383 spurious, being, in his estimation, not
worthy of virgin but his arguments are by
no means sufficient to lead us to doubt its
genuineness. On Palinurus, see end of Bk.
v. The description is imitated from the simi-
lar character, Elpenor, in Hom. Od. xi. 51

 

8238. Libyco cursw-in the voyage from
ma, ln that part of it, however, which

effusus,

note, AEu. i. ¹2, 307.

346. En, in questions expressive of irony
or indign-anon, which approach rather to the
character of exclamations. denotes strong
feeling of mind, as longing and sorrow.
wrath, etc. See Hand, Turseli. vol. ii. p
371. Fides is constantly used by the poets
for the issue or fulfilment of a prophecy.

and Illustration there.

348. Deus—‘⁴ any deity'' (not Apollo), in
reply to the question quis deorum in 341.

350. Cui haerebam et reqebam—for et quo
regebam. For examples of similar omissione
of the relative, see Ecl. viii. 3, 4, Geu iii
*23ae iv. S, 10.

352. Pro me, instead of the more common
de me, νπὲρ ἐμοῦ· Me, the aecus. before
cepisse is omitted, since it is evident what
the subject must be.

353. Armis—⁴⁴ the tiller,'' nowhere else
used of it alone. E.z·cussa maqistro, for uni-
formity with spolxata armis, instead of mco·
,qi-stro ez‘cusso.

357. Sublimis ab unda—ie.. as he sat on
the ymber-naculum which had been torn ofil

359. Cum reste—either “together with my
garmeuts, which were soaked as well as
myself,'' or the cum is redundant, as it often
is in the poets.

361. Ignara—not knowing what chan&
had cast me into the sea, but supposing that
I had been wrecked, and that I had conse-
quently endeavoured to save as much of my
riches as possible.

362.11[e,i.e.‚ corpus meum. So Homer says,

αὐτοὺς δὲ ἑλώρια τεῦχε, etc, Versant-
the winds now drive the body in to shore,
and now out to sea. Cf: Etuip. Hec. 28.

365. His malis-ie, that my corpse is
unburied. Terram injioe—not the simple
ceremony of a handful of dust (see Hor. Od.
i. 28. 3), but regular funeral rites.

366. munos—by anticipation, asVelia was
not founded sor a long time afterwards.
Velia was a city of Lucania (called by the
Greeks Elea, ie, Ρελὲα), between Paestum
and Cape Palinurus, celebrated afterwards
through the Eleatic philosopher Zeno and
his followers. It was built in the time of
Cyrus by the Phocaeam, whom that prince
had expelled from their territories. For
examples of similar prolepsis, see viii. 361.

373. Dira-“mad, and unable to be gra.-
tified.“ The adj. is used in reference to all
things which are severe, or dreadful beyond
measure.

377. Cape memor-ie, “ listen to, and ro-
