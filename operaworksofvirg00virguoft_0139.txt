75. This and the preceding line are con-
demned by Rau as containing a languid aud
superfluous addition.

Thiel considers pulchra prole as a (so-
called) abl. absoL, and thus interprets:
“quae te saciat parentem, ut pulchra proles
sit.’' But the plain meaning of the words
is the best,--“ and shall make you a father
by the beautiful children she will bear:''
or “ shall bless you with children, and that,
too, beautiful ones.'' The ancients thought
it a most severe dispensation to be disap-
pointed in the hope of children, as may be
seen in such places as the present, and in
the very frequent mention of the misfor-

tune of a δόμος ’ἡμιτελής by the Greeks.

76. Aeolus avoids all risk of incurring
blame, by simply promising to do her com-
mands without approving of them in word.
The hint of Aeolus in implorare, that J uno
should examine how far it was right to ask
him to go in his compliance, is a prepara-
tion for the indignation of Neptune, 130 sqq.,
at the audacity of the king of the winds.

77. capessere, i.e., accwere et exsequi. Fas
est, i.e., officium meum esc.

78. Observe the repetition of the pronoun
to express emction and emphasis. Cf. Geo.
iv. 465 sqq. The mythological fancy which
represented Juno as the personification of
the lower air will account sor the idea that
the slovereignty of the winds was at her dis-
posa .

79. ancilias, etc. “Thou hast granted
to me whatever sovereignty I possess ς thou
hast procured for me my sceptre, and hast
secured me the favour of J upiter3 thou hast
gained for me a seat at the table of the
gods, and hast made me Lord over storm-
clouds and tempests.” The Presents, con-
cilias and das, are not to be taken as if used
sor Perfects, but as expressing that the bene-
fits formerly conferred by Juuo's kindness
are still continued by her indulgence. and are
- cherished with gratitudo. In concilias go-
verning sceptra and Jovem, we have au
approximation to, but not a distinct example
of, the figure Ζειιρηῑας for an explanation
ot'which, see note ii. 258, and consult Mud-
vig, Zumpt, Jelf, and Latham‚ by Index.

81. Conversa cuspide, etc. — Λ With in-

sceptre) he forced (a. part of) the hollow
mountain into its side,'' i.e., drove a hole
in it from his throne on the outside and

summit where he sat} or, “struck the hol- ·

low mountain on the side.'⁷ Those who,
with Dr Henry (see above, 56), suppose his
throne in the inside, will render it, “He

spear, which he held in his hand aq a scep-
tre, leaning· with one end on the ground,
being changed from the veitical to th«
horizontal position? This latter explana
tion is most consistent with 140. ln
Henry argues, that ifAeolus was seated 011
the summit of the mountain, he must have
struck it on the top, not cn the side, aud
then the winds would have rushed heaven-
wards, instead of along the surface of the
earth. This is. perhaps, rather much of a
refinement, though we consess that Dr H.'s
other arguments are to us conclusive. 'We
shouid have liked to insert them but sor their
