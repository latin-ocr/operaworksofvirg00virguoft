249. Hatpyias insontes. Bothe places
the adj. first. thus restoring the reading

ner, and Forb., on the ground that the
epithet‚ coming ctfler the caesura, acquires
more force by the necessary emphasis in
pronunciation.

275. Formiclatns Apollo, i.e., the temple
of Apollo, dreaded by marincrs on account
ot' the rocks on which it was built. IIeyno
thinks that the temple ot' the Action Apollo
at Accium is meant, and not that on Leucata.
'I’he mention os the gyames makes for this
opinion, while the southern position ot‘ the

was invited in partem: and, morcover, cx-
piatory and pnriticatory sacrifices were pro-
perly made to Jupiter, as the avengcr of
murder, and os every crime for which atone-
ment was to be made. Heyne.
