ARGUMENT.

Dino having become violently enamoured of AEneas, consults her sister Anna 011 her cir-
cumstances, aud by her is advised to consent to marriage with the Trojan prinee (1-53).
Dido's feelings further described (ΓΑ-89). <Iuno consults with Veuus; both agree to the
union now so much desired by Dido, Juno devising a plan by which to bring it about
reo-128). The queen proposes a hunting excursum, which accordingly takes place: but
«nrm all are earnest in the pur-suit of the garne, a violent thunderstorm is sent down by
J 11110, causing the hunters to fly in different directions: AEneas and Dido, however, acci-
dentally take shelter in the same eave (1-29-172). Soon after this event„ Jupiter, roused
by the remonstrances of Iarbas, sends Mercury to AEueas with an authoritative command
to leave Africa and make for Italy (173-278), which order the son of Venus prepares to
obey (279-295). Dido immediately suspects the intentioris of AEneas, and expostulates
with him, but in vain (296-449); and, accordingly, being unable to bear up against her
grief, she detemiines to die (450-473). Concealing her purpose from her sister, she erects
u huge pyre, and pretends that it is intended sor the celebration of mag-ic ceremonies, by
which she mav be enablcd to shake off'her affection for AEneas, and to forget him alto-
gether (474-521). Her grief now increases to fremy: but by this time AEneas has weighed
nnchor, nnd stands out to sea in the middle of the night (522-583). In the morning, Dido,
maddened by the sight of the Trojan ships in the distant offing‚ breaks out in a paroxysm
os love-sick sorrow, and imprecatos calamitics on her once cherished guest (584-629):
and having dismissed all her attendants, she slays herself on the pyre (630-705).
