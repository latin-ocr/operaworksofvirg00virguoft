B. 11. 650-688

Anchises was said to have been maimed
sor divulging his intimacy with Venus, and 1
to this it. is supposed reference is mado by
him.

650. Ficus, i.e.‚ loco. Per-stabat memo-
rans, “persisted in repeating his determi-
uati0n.''

651. Effusi lacrimis, ie.. z'n lacrimas,
“dissolved iu tearsl' Obtestati sumus, or
some such word. is to be supplied to goz-eru
the clause introduced by sed.

652. Wrterc÷erertere Cuncta, mesot·-
tnne Qt‘ all, sor the others were detcrniincd
not to abandon him. ν

654. Observe haeret applied in different
scnses to incepto and sedibus. (Zeugma.)

661. Isti janua leto patet—“a means of
approach to that death which you court is
opcn.” Iste has always a reference to the
secondpers.

665. Eripis for eripuisti, but strongcr‚ as

and art. even now can-ying out plans which
shall keep me free from harm.''

667. cernam—this pres. tense is unusual,
but the sense requires, “to see as Ι do fleis
φημ’ Erat (664) refers to the coimscl
adopted by Venus in reference to AEncas
at a time now past—the results, however,
are still felt.

670. Nunquam—“ by no means.'‘
sometimes use net-er.

674. Patri, i.e.‚ mihi, AEneas.

678. Quondam implies a taunt to AEneas,

as if he no longer cared for his wife, when
he was thus ready to abandon her to her
sate. -
682. Levis apex—‘⁴ a slight taperin g flame.''
Burmann takes apen· to mean the thiu coni-
cal top of the Phrygian cap3 but line <3:35 is
opposed to this view. The phenomenon was
supposed to portend regal power to the
person on whose head it appeared. See
AEn. vii. 71 sqq„ and Livy, Bk. i.‚ c. 39.
Thescience of electricity accounts satisfac-
torily for such appearances.

683. Tacta depends on innoxia, and not
on lambere.

684. Lambere-this is a favourite word to
express the flickering of a blaze, which so
closely imitates the playing of the tongue
round an object.

Mollis (i.e.‚ molles) agreeing with comm,
and thus the awkwardness of two epithets
to flamma will be avoided. Pasas-eom-
bustible matter being the food of fire, the
blaze is said- to browse upon the hair.

685. stepidare—means to run around
Iulus under the influence of dread and
anxiety, but there is not contained in the
word any idea of running up to. Metu ἀβ-
pends on pavidi. ν

686. ,Sanaos—as sent from heaven.

688. coelo, i.e.‚ ad coelum, as often in the
poem· retendit, observe the zeuyma.

comparing such phrases as pufflzscm puonare,
stu-orem furere, aequora currere (=cursu7n
maritimum currere), would remove the
semicolon after nos, and interpret, “cast
upon us but this one propitious glance‚'' as
it· it were hunc tantum adspectum nos adspice.

But the more simple explanation is to be
preferred—“Look upon us: this only do 1
neg—for one glauce is sufficient to excite
thy compassion.'' Gossrau omits the punc·
tuation marks after tantum and et, and,
viewing et as placed in a somewhat unusual
position, would interpret thus: “And, if

Ladewig favours the interpretation of
W’agner, making· hoc depend on adspzce (as
id in the phrase id te hortor). Anchises
was seeking for a second augmy to confirm
the first. See Judges ἡ. 39.

692. Fraqore. lVakefield, Lucr. v. 318,
explains this as meaning a burstirzq of the
hem-ens, and a dividing of the clouds.

tae=“whcn.'' This eonjunction is osten
used when the writer hastens from one
subject to another, or when he indicates
that something is hastily executed after
another, so that no time, as it were, elapses
between the two events. See lVagn. Quaest.

697. Salvus—the meteor lest a furrow—1
track, in the heaven, which was conspicu-
ous by its greater brightness aster the
brilliant nucleus of the fiel-y body had de-
scendcd lower to the horizon.

703. Vestro ῐη numine TroJ'a est. Anchises,
who was skilled in augin-y, drew from the
omens that Iulus would prove a glory to
his race, and would restore the kingdom of
Troy in another land. Therefore he says,
“Troy (i.e., the Trojans-—the Trojan race
and interest).is an object of your guardian
care and solicitude: it is not yet entirely
overthrown: it will rise from its ruins, and
once more rude in powenJ' This is the
explanation adopted by Burmann. Wun-
derlich‚ Wagner, and Forbiger. Heyne's
is different, but does not deservo mention.
