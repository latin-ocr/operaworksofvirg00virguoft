by Ulysses. Observe the peculiar form of
the gen. in ι’, on which see i. 3ος ii. ⁴275.

437. Protz'nz‘ts is said to refer to time,
protenzks to space, but the distinction is not
sully borne out by examples.

440. Sic is to be joined with indomitum
—-“so ruthlessly do we see,¹' ete„ or
“so furious a battle.'' In the line above,
bella is used for proelia, as osten in the
poets.

441. The testudo here mentioned was one
made of shields, and not the warlike ina-

chine of later times. Consult Ramsay‘s
Antiquities.

 

442. Τὴε present tense is used, the better
to bring us in medias res, and thus to im-
part life, spirit, and quickness to the nar-
rative. How much more lively, and how
much more indicative of magic speed is
haerent than the prosaic admoventur.

Parietibus is to be pronormced pei-yctibus
by synizesis.

443. “ With their lest nands they present
their bucklers to the weapons, to defend
themselves; with their right they endeav-
our to grasp the battlements of the roof.

446. His—“with such weapons as tl1ese.''

Ultima, τὰ ’ἔσχατα- Conveniam—¹⁶ pull
at‚” i.e., “try to pull down.¹’

448. Observe the ‹ufference between de-
cus, decoris, and decor, decoris.

4251. Instaurare animum, forrqficere, re-
creare, is very seldom found, if ever, else-
where. “Our fiery spirit was re-kindled.''

453. Observe the variation of expression
in this sentence, and the ornament bestowed
on a matter of so humble a kind—unm,
fores, usus and postes, being all employed
to the same object. A tergo is not confined
to postes relicti, but applies to the whole
sentence, as Dr Henry rightly remarks,
Class. Mus. vol. vii. Translate, srecly, thus:
“ In the rear (of the building) there was an

456. Incomz'tnta. Greek aud Trojan ma.-
trons were not in the habit of going forth
alone. See Hom. 11„ iii. 143. Saepius sole-
bant—such pleonasms are frequent among
ourselves.

457. Ad soceros, ‘⁴ to her parents-in-law,”
i.e., ad socerum et socrum, viz., Priam and
Hecuba; so below, 579, patres=patrem ee

Trahebat-this verb suits well the half-
walking, half-running, tiptoe gait ot* achild
ted by the hand.

458. Evado, “1111011nt,”i.0., adse-eudendo
supero. Fastz'gz'mn means the extreme
point of a thing, here, therefore, there is a
superfluity of epithet, similar to Ovid. Met.
ii. 1, Regia solis erat sublimibus alta colum-
uls.

459. Irrita, ‘⁴ useless,'' not that they
failed to inflict wounds, but that they were
unavailing to prevent the destruction of
Troy.

460. “A turret standing on the precipi-
tons ledge of the building, and raised high
in air, with very lofty pinnacles (or, raised
high in {n'r from the topmost roos), troni
which (tower) all Troy, and the ships of
the Greeks, and t'he Achaean camp were
wont to be seen, having attached on every
side with iron weapons, where the highest
storcys rendered the joinings less firm, we

translation best to take the acc. first.

462. Note the mesozeugma in solt'lae
agrecing with naves, the middle subsc. of the
three to which it belongs. For an example
of protozeugma, in which the adj. agrees
with the first only, sec AEn. i. 623, 4. Casus
milii cognitus * * ’¹‘ nomenque tuum rc-

may be found in Ecl. i. 53, 59.

466. Trahit. Although the two prc-
ceding verbs convellimus and impulimus
are past tenses (Aorist), yet trahit is pre-
sent, because its action immediately follows,
and the time is present in reference to that
expressed by them. Cf. 481-4.

Dare ruinam means, to “sali wt'tlz α
crasl1,’' but tralzere rumam suggests far-
ther a considerable time occupied in the sall,
and a greater extent of space covered by
the fragments.

470. Exsultat expresses the quiek motion
of Pyrrhus bounding. now here, now there,
now forwards, now backwards, his 'orazcn
weapons omitting a gleaming light.
