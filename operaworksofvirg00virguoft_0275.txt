667. Musaeus—a semi-mythological per-
sonage of the same class as Olen and Or-
pheus and by one tradition called the son

to examine and make oneself familiar with
future events. Studio, i.e., studiose.

685. Alacres is the nom. and not the acc.

713. “Those souls, unto which other bodies
are due by fate, quaff at the water of the
Lethaean n‘ver care-dispelling· draughts, and
a lasting sorgetfulness (of the past).‘’ The
poet now enters, in the person of Anchises,
upon certain philosophica] dogmas founded
upon the tencts of the Pythagoream school.
with some additions borrowed from the Pla-
tonic system. The substance of these cloc-
trines is simply this: After the soul is freed
froin the chains of the body, it passes into
the regions of the dead, where it remains,
undergoing purgations of one kind or other,
1111 it is sent back to this world to be the
inhabitant os some other body, brutal or
human 3 and after suffering in this way suc-
cessive purgatione, and animating in turn
different bodies, it is finally received into
the heavens, and returns to and becomes
merged 111 the great essence, or soul of the
world, of which it was originally an emana-
tion. Moreover, before each of these several
departures to the upper world to inhabit

The idea that spirits returned to uppel
earth was commonly entertained by thr.=
ancients, but it seems a peculiar notion of
Plato's (Rep. x. p. 621, Α. Steph.)that they
drank first of Lethe. On Plato and his
doctn'nes, see “Greek and Roman Philo<
sophy'' (Griffin, Glasgow), p. 53 sqq.

dictum, says Heyne, as pallidos morbos,
⁴‘ diseases that render persons pale.’'

716. Has—some special ones singled out
from the mass, sor the doctrine of metem-
psychosis did not include all who died.

717. The repetition of the demonstr. pron.
llas, hanc, of the verbs memorare and
enumerare, so closely allied in signification,
renders a copulative conj. unnecessary. ⁴
