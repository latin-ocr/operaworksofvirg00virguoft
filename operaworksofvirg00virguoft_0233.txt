5: . Forma def. non deus ipse—sec 571.
Re euntis, i.e., iterum euntis.

558. Omnia, vocem,colr›1·cm,etc—sinum—
another example of the accus. os reference
01· limitation, 011 which sce note, AEn. i. ⁴228,
and ii. 210. The voice, the complexion, the
golden looks, and the gracesul, well—turned
limbs, are the marks of beauty sor which
Mercury was distinguished among deities.
On the synapheia ot* que aster colorem, see
AEu. i. 332, note.

559. Black· being the prevailing colour of
the hair of Greeks and Romans, they prized
highly the flavos crines as more rare and
beautiful. See Antiq.

560. Sub hoc casu—“ at the crisis in whielz
you now are''—such is the force os hoc.

Ducere somnos, like trahere 501711103,messns

to enjoy proti-acted sleep, εὕδειν παννύχιον.
561. Demde, in interrogation& is often
almost equal to ‘⁴ Quum res ita sint.''

562. Zephyros, as auster at iii. 70, is not
to be taken literally, but as signifyiug xlae
wind, generally. The wind called Africus
(W. S.W.) would have been more savourable
for those sailing from Carthago to Italy.

564. Certa mori—see above, 554, and cf.
475.

565. Potestas praecipitare. On the differ-
ence between the infin. and the gerund after
such a subst.‚ and on the syntax of the infin.
in this construction, see a full note, AEn. ii.
3:30, v. 638, and Geo. i. 305.

566. Jam is used of an event which we
confidently expect to happen immediately.
Tin-bari trabibus, i.e., with the ships of the
Carthaginians. Gossr. takes it to mean that
unless AEneas made haste to escape, the sea
would, on the morrow, be strewed with the
fragments of his ships, broken up and burned
by the Carthagiuians.

567. struere-see above, 407.

569. Eia aye is expressive ot* the greatest
impatience.

570. Varium et mutabile semperfemz'na—
a well known proverb. The neut. of an adj.
Joined to a masc. or fem. subst., expresses
some degree of contempt and depreciation.
The construction is frequent both in Greek
and Latin: Thus Ovid Am. i. 9, 4, Turpe
est senez· miles. Triste lupus stabulis, etc.
Res is sometimes put iu apposition instead
of the nent. of the adj„ thus Ov. Met. vii.
826, credula res amor est.

The proverb aut amat aut odit mulier,
nillil tertium, is similar in sentiment to ‘the
above.

571. Subz'tz's umbris—“the sudden dark-
ness consequent on the departure of the
god who had appeared, as deities were
wont, in a halo of light.'’ Thus Heyne and
Gossrau. But Hem-y suggests that umbrae

here means the simulacrum, φάντασμα of

Jupitefto require to despatch his messen-
ger twice, in person, to AEncas. Os this
lVagn., in his smaller edition, approvcs.
Forb. leans to the same interpretation.

573. Praecipites is to he applied to con-
sidae, but not to vigilate, say the commen-
tators. It appears to us, however, that it
is equally applicable to both, for an adj.
thus used, where an adv. might have been
expected, is in most cases equal 111 meaning
to a separate and independent assertion, aa
if it were, “Make all haste (praecipites),
ronse yourselves from sleep (vigilate), and
take your scats on the 1·owi·ng-l)enches.''
So, in the next line, citi is not for cito, but
is equal to “Be quie-k (md unfurl.''

If the address, zu'gilnte, were consmcd to
those of the traiu whose duty it was to be
on guard for the night, we might allow the
rcstriction in the use of praecipites ; but
as we cannot for a moment imagine, either
(1) that al] the companions of AEneas were
on guard on the night previous to the re-
11011Ἧὶ of their labours, 01· (2) that the orders
osthen- chief would be given to a part only
of the forces, we seem confincd to the ex-
planation now hazarded.

576. Sancte deorum -- imitated, says
Heyne, from Ennius, Juno Saturnia,
sancta deorum, and this from Homer, 31¹2

θεάων· The poets, and later prose writers,
used the positive degree of adjS. in a parti-
tive sense, governing the gen.

577. Quisquis es — with this compare
notes on 556 and 571.

578. Dextra sz'de7·a—-—“p1·opitious stars‚''
on the rising of “ which the winds depended,
in the opinion of the ancients.

581, Habet—“possesses.'⁷ Rapiuntque,
ruuntque, followed by the pert] deseruere (in
α moment, as it were, they are off), admir-
ably express the extraordinary activity and
speed of execution of the various duties of
seizing and arranging the cordage aud tack-
ling of the ship, of taking the posts 01
rowers 01· sailors, and of putting forth to
sea. Note the sound answering to the sense
in this and the following verse.

584, 5. The reader of Homer will have
little difficulty in turning to 11. xi. 1, for
the original of these lines. Tithonus was a
son of Laomedon, king ot’ Troy, of whom
Aurora became enamoured.

586. Ε speculis, i.e., from the higher part
of her palace, to which, as a watch-tower,
she had retired at the early peep of grey
dawn to have a view over the harbour.

587. AEqzzcctis velis—“with sails equally
