the clement: thus also we have Vulcanus
for iym's, Liber for Vinum, Mars for bellum,
Venus for amor, etc. etc. Cerealia arma,
Le„ instruments sor grindhig and baking.
Arma is not contmed to warlike weapons,
but means implements generally, sor any

181. Pelayo is the dat. case, as alto, 126,
above, sor as we have already seen, the pects
often use the dat. to express the place or
point to >which a thing is directed. Si,
“whether or no he can see any one (of his
,ost companions as) Antheus,'¹ ete. The
proper names, Anthea, Capyn, ete„ are in
apposition to quem. Gossrau, however, ob-
jects to this, and compares the use of quem to
cin (an, one) in German. Pektyus means the
deep sea always, as opposed to that near to
the land. Oceanus is the “ great waste of
waters'' surroundz'nq the earth. Mare, the
sea as opposed to the land and sky. Pontus,
t-he sea in reference to pemenclicular dimen-
sion. Aequor and Marmor refer to the sm·-
t'ace merely in its level and glassy aspect.

AEn. v. 119. See Ramsay's Antiq. Rom. p.
402 sqq.

184. Cervos—Some naturalists of former
times alleged that there were no stags
in Africa; but Sha10,i11 his “Travels'' (other
authorities omitted), says that animals of
this class are fomid there. At all events,
we are not to bind down the poet to be a
mere recorder of ver-itable facts of natural
histor .

185.yArmen ta from aro, quasi stramen ta, as

jumenta, quasi juqztmenta. The word is
properly applied to oxen, but also to floeks
of animals of other kinds; 50 seals are called
Neptuni armenta in Geo. iv. 395.

193. For fundat and aequet some books
readfundit-aequat; but the subjunctive is
better, since the poet wishes to express
the desire of AEneas not to desist tiu he
should have slatn seven stags, and thus pro-
vided one carcase for each ship, rather than
his actual scats. Humi 15 the correct reading,

and not hzmw, for virgil uses the former

ad terram, while the latter means a terra
or e terra. For examples of its use, see
Gossrau in loc.

198. Ante malornm, ’τῶν πρὶν κακοῖν·
So in Sall. Jug. 76, 5, multo ante labore fa-
mati, 011 which, see Kritz ad loe. This
figure, by which adverbs are so joined to
adJectives and substantives as to make one
compound word, and one s'unplc idea, is

called hyphen (ὑφ’ ἒνῆς), but is foreign to
the idiom of the Latin language, and is
seldoni used. Others take ante for antea,

Gossrau‘s opinion.

202. Moestmn—“sadness-causing,’' iu an
active sense. But Gossrau explains differ-
ently. He says, “Abstrcaect notions, which
can only be discerned when manifested in
concrete object-s, rightly assume adjectives
which are suited to the concretes to which
they are attributed.” Thus moestus is pro-
perly applied to timidus (used as a concrete
subst., 3 “ coward‘'), and may therefore be
transferred to timor—-tne correspondinq ab-
straet subst.

203. Haec means our present difficulties
and discouragements. Forsan is a poetic
word very rarely used by prose writers
&who adopt forsitan), and not at all by

icero.
