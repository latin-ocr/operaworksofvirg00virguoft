lt is better, even should we entirely disallow
the suspected verseS, to keep the two words
separate and distinct, each having its pecu-

the Roman poet endeavoured to combine
the subject of war (arma) and the personal
adventures of one ot* its chiefs (cirum) in
the same book, though his great exemplar

signification. on the ground that in this
place, where every word is put down with
its fun weight and importance, Virgil would
not likely depart from the primary and pro-
per meaning of the ternis. Hc iuges far-
ther. that the adj. in its most literal sense,
is thoroughly correct, for though Antenor
from Troy settled among the Veneti at the
north extremity of the Adriatic gulf prior
to the arrival of AEneas, yet that district
could not be taken into account, since Italia
Antiqua did not reach sofar, being bounded
on the north by the Rubicon.

ermion, and the sato shows that our hero's
exile is not the consequence of misdeeds or
of a diseased anibition, but that the finger
of heaven ‹lii'ected events. ΨΘ frequently
find, in both poets and prose writers, the
names, not only of towns and small islands,
but also of countries and regions construed
without the prep.‚ when motion towards is
signified. The writers of the Augustan age,
however, are guilty of the omission only in
the case of islauds and maritime countries,
the approach to which is by sea. Even in
common nouus. and in other cases than the
Acc. (iii. 162) the same peculiarity is occa-
sionally found. Cf. AEn. i. 201, 307. See

more closely defined, by the former. Thus

Observe the synizesz's in in-vi-ny3<
que. Synz'zesis, or ngczeresis is the run-
ning into one syllable in pronunciation
two vowels which properly constitute two
separate syllables. It is very common in
the poets before Virgil,—-m0re rare in virgil
lliniselxss—and still more rare in those poets
who followed liiin3 thus alveo, ferrei, pre-
cantia, mentis, etc. etc, for otherwise many
words could not have been admitted into
hexameter verse. See note 131, below.
Some books read Lat-ina, but see note on
line 270. The district where AEneas after-
wards founded Lavinium, is called Lat-inico
littora by anticipation (prolepsis). This is
a species of anachronism in which Virgil
often indulges. Laurentum was called
Lavinium (after Lavinius, a brother of La-
tinus) in the first instance, previous to the
adoption of the former name. bnt it again
received the name Lavinium from Lavinia,
the daughter of Latinus, and wife of AEneas
