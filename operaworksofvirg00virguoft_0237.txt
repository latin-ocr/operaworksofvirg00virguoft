ARGUMENT.

AExnffi, leaving Carthage‚ sets sail for Italy. but. by the violence of a tempest, is a
sec-ond thne driven on the coast of Sicily, where, assistet} by the fiziendly azo-operation oi
Acestes, he celebrates games at his father Anchises* tomb, on the anniversary of his
death (1-603). But in the meantime, the Trojan women, being instigated by Iris, the
messenger of Juno, set fire to the ships, of which four are burned, the others being ,
miraculously preserved by Jupiter (604-699). Anchises appears to AEneas in a vision on
the following night, and gives him advice and direction with regard to his future course
(700-740). AEneas founds the town of Acesta, and leaves, as colonists, many of the
matrons, and the old men imfit for active service in war, and he himself again puts to
sea with his fleet for Latium (741-778) In this voyage, Neptune renders the ocean
propitious, and, at length, after his many wanderings, our hero reaches Italy, having,
however, lost his pilot, Palinurus. when near the Hesperian coast (779-871).
