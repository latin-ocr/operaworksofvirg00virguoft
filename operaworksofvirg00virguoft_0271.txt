the prep., but it is retained by Forb. and
others, on the ground that virgil usually
avoids the concurrence of adj. and subst. by
the interposition of a prep. Were the prep.
not inserted, the arsis would frequently fall
successive-,ly on two similar endings, as bello
ea: tanto—Silva in magna. On the proper
name, see AEn. iii. 108.

507. The arms of the hero were deposited
on the cenotaph and his name given to the
place, so that, according to the poet, there

was on the Trojan coast a Δηιφὸβου αἷμα.
Te-on the hiatus, and the shortening of
{¹0⁰1 lign5g3syllable, see note, AEn. i. 16, aud

508. Ponere, ie, humare. See ii. 644, and
ιν. 681. Patria depends on decedens, and
terra on ponere.

510. Funeris umbris—“the shacle of my
eorpse,” because the‘ body itself had not
been found.

511. ,Sed osten marks a return to a sub-
ject before mentioned; thus it here has re-
ference to the question of AEneas in 501,
and may be explained by the fuller expres-
sion, Sed quoniam istud quaeris.

Lacaenae, ie, Helen, as found previously
at ιι. 601. Deiphobus had been married to
her after the death of Paris.

513. With this narrative compare AEn. ii.
25 and 248 sqq., also Eur. Hec. 898 sqq.

517. G'Izorum simulans—pretending a re-
ligious rite, a solemn dance in honour of
Bacchus, but really to give a signal to the
Greeks when they ought to attack the city.

Evantes-the acc. plur. The construction

is Phryyias evantes orqia, εὐαζούσαις τοὶ

ὄργια· Evare, i.e.. Evoe clamare, Baccha-
nalia concelebrare, is a very rare word used
only in the participle, and found in Catull.
lxiii. 3923 Sil. i. 1013 and. Apul. Met.·‚ in
all which places it is intransitive, but here

it has, after the Greek fashion, an accus. οὶ

the object, orata. Forb.

519. ,Summa ex arce. Standing on the
summit of the citadel she summoned the
Greeks by uplisting the torch. Agamemnon
returned the signal from his flag ship, and
thus Sinon knew the moment at which to
open the horse. Virgil's account of the
affair is made more feasible by the pretendecl
Bacchanalian rite, celebrated for the depar-
ture of the Greeks, and at night too.

521. The poet is hardly consistent with
himself in this passage as compared with
the Episode, AEn. ii. 567 sqq. He may have
followed different traditions on the subject.

523. Eqreqia, “glorious‚” '‘peerleSS‚’' used
ironioally—as we say, “ precious.”

524. Subduzerott, “ had pn'vately taken
away my §word before the other weapons.''

But the pluperf. inay be explained as at
AEu. ii. 259, where sec note.

528. Thalama Silius also uses irrumpere
with the dat. Some copies read thalamos.

529. AEolides, a name applied to Ulysses,
expressive of the most bitter moekery, for
his mother Anticlea had been a kind of eon-
cubine to Sisypnus, son of AEolus‚ before
sho became the wife of Laertes, father oi
Ulysses.

530. Instaurant, ie, command that all
these events happen afresh in rotation, but
that the Greeks be this time the objeets.

532. Pelagi, ete, ie.. Have you been
driven by the storms of the sea to the place
where is the entrance to these regions, or
do you come on purpose, in accordance with
an admonition from heaven? The very re-
mote ancients believed that the descent to
Orcus lay at the extreme limits of the
ocean.

535. Hac vice—“At this turn (or point)
of the conve1·sation;'' or= “During this mu-
tual converse;'' ie, whilst they thus con-
versed.

· Aurora, according to the ancients, accom-

panied the sun in all his course. The word
is therefore equal to Sol. Four horses are
here given to Aurora, but only two at vii.
26, as at Hom. Od. xxiii. 247.

536. Heyne has found great difficulties in
arranging and accounting for the hours and
pen'ods of the jorn-ney to Hades. But Voss,
Cerda, etc„ seem rightly to dispose them
thus: AEneas and the Sibyl, after the noe-
turnal magio ceremony, set out at dawu
(primi sub lumina solis, et ortus, 255) on
their descent to Orcus, and occupied the
whole forenoon and the meridian hours in
examining those objects which have been
already mentioned. The evening now ap-
proaches, on which account the Sibyl has-
tens AEneas, since much is yet to be seen
and done. and they are under the necessity
of returning to earth before sunrise of the
following morning.

537. On fors, see note, AEn. ii. 139.

540. Ambus, simply for duas. Ditis
moenia, ie, the palace of Pluto. The
comma usually placed aster dextera has
been removed by Forb., since dextera quae
=quarum dextera.

542. Elysium, for in Elysium. See note,
AEn. i. 2; οἱ also ιιι. 507.

543. Exercet poenas. By a poetic con-
ception, the road which leads to the place
of punishment is said actually to inflict the
punishment. Observe that what ought to
be merely one enunciation (ad Tartarum
mittens exercet poe-nas) is expressed in two»
as may be seen at ΕΠ. v. 6113 Eel. vi. 20,
Geo- ιιι. 417, etc.
