619, Vestem. The goddess Im's was re-

620. Tmarii—from Tmarus (or Tomaros),
a Mt. of Epirus near Dodona. But as
Beroe is called Rhoeteia, i. e., Trsfiana,
(t‘rom the promontory of Rhoeteium) iu 646,
below, a contradiction seems to be evidcnt,
and therefore some have read Ismarii, from
Ismarus a Mt. of Thrace, since it is pro-
bable that Bero'e‘ would marry a Thracian
rather than an Epirote, Thrace being in
ternis of alliance with Troy; but we may
readily suppose that Beroe migrated to
Epirus with Helenus, that she there con-
tracted marriage with Doryclus (not the son
ot‘ Priam, who, it will be remembered, was
slain at Troy, Hom. 11. xi. 489), and after-
wards joined the expedition of AEneas,
when it left. the coasts of Chaonia for Italy.

621. Cui is better referred to Dorycli
than to cony'uoe, for nomen is then more
suitable. Genus means nobility os birth.

Fuzssent is put in the subj., as expressing
the cause why the goddess assumed the
form of Beroe'. And the reason is assigned
ln 651, viz„ that Beroe was siek, and there-
{ore could not 'mter-vene to disclose the
fraud. Cat is equal to quippe cuz, or to
quum ei.

633. Tempus ayt res—“that matters be

endeavoured to convey an accurate idea of
the syntax, which is not to be considered a
Graecism, nor is the infin. to be looked on as
equal to a gerund. The difference is this,
when the infin. is used as here, it serves as
the subject, the verb esse (expressed or un-
derstood) as the simple copula, and the subst.
as the predicate, thus res aqi (that aetion be
taken) est (is) tempus (seasonable). So in
Geo. i. 305, Tempus strinqere mandes,- where
tempus is equal to tempestivum. But, ou the
other hand, in the construction with the
gerund, the subst. is the subject, the gerund
the gen. ot* the object, and esse contains the
predicata thus tempus esc aqendz} ¹¹ The
