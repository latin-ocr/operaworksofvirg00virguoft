¹ 181. Novo veterum errore Iocorum. For
lengthened annotation on this diffieult and
much canvassed passage, we must refer
students to the commentators, contenting
ourselves with the mention of that explana-
tion which appears most simple and con-
sistent with 1110 context. As AEneas had
formerly (13 sqq.) erred in his attempted
settlement in Thrace, having considered
that as the land destined 10 111111 by fate, so
now, a second 111110, 110 15 forced to abandon
his supposed kingdom, and again set forth
111 quest of the ever—receding territory. He
did not err, however, in his interpretation
of the orac-le, but in his choica of place.
Transl: “He acknowledged that he had
been led astray by a second mistake with
regard to the lands ot' ancient celebrity''
(in the history of the origin of the Trojans).
The late Dr Moor (Glasgow University)
suggested, “misled with regard to these
ancient countries (Crete and Italy) by the
later voyage‚'' i.e.‚ he consounded the voy-
gge of Teucer with the earlier one of Dar-
